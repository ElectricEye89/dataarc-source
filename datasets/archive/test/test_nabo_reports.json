Investigations in Mývatnssveit for the past fourteen years have resulted in major excavation programs of both structures and midden deposits at Hofstaðir, Sveigakot, and Hrísheimar, with smaller scale midden excavations and test trenching at Steinbogi, Selhagi, Oddastaðir, Brenna, and Thorleifstaðir combined with a comprehensive foot survey of the district (continued in 2008 by Oscar Aldred and Christian K. Madsen, see their separate report). The LoS program has greatly improved our understanding of the timing and processes of the Viking age Landnám in Iceland, and the value of multiple sites of different social status and local environment tied together by the isochrones provided by the critical V871 and V940 tephra has been clearly demonstrated. The strategy of a long term commitment to research in a single district and the “longitudinal” perspective provided has become a key element in the research agenda of Historical Ecology and Human Ecodynamics5 , and the LoS is now one of several similar landscape-scaled investigations in the region. In many respects, Mývatnssveit is now one of the most intensively researched and best documented portions of the Norse North Atlantic, and one of a very few Viking Age multi-site cultural landscapes now known anywhere."

        "Text": "However, the LoS has been far more successful in documenting the earlier phases of settlement in Mývatn than the later periods (somewhat reversing the normal situation in Iceland and elsewhere). We actually have far less evidence in Mývatnssveit for the later Middle Ages and early modern periods (ca. 11001850), and nowhere had we found a continuous archaeological record covering the whole period of human settlement in the region. In 2006 we began a cooperative project under the Human and Social Dynamics of Global Change program of US NSF led by Astrid Ogilvie (HSD: Human and Social Dynamics in Mývatnssveit, Iceland, from the Settlement to the Present) aimed at connecting the archaeological record with the historical documents for land use and landscape change with interviews with senior farmers in the district. The archaeology team has been tasked with locating midden deposits contemporary with the historical data sets, and to support the overall objectives of connecting more distant past with the present. In 2006 we did locate early modern deposits at Hofstaðir and Narfastaðir, but failed to locate the large and continuous midden deposits needed to link to the large Viking Age collections. In 2007, a larger scale survey project aimed at locating and testing middens (using soil corers and small test trenches) was carried out under the leadership of Orri Vésteinsson with the aim of locating deeper midden deposits extending from recent times to the medieval period. The 2007 survey located and tested middens at multiple sites (Beinistaðir, Hofstaðir, Graenavatn, Geirastaðir, Litla Gotland, Thorleifstaðir, Baldursheimar, Grímstaðir) but the key discovery of the 2007 season was made by Arni Einarsson, who observed a patch of erosion at the southern edge of the green field behind the modern farm and church area at Skútustaðir had exposed a patch of well preserved mammal and fish bones (the site is clearly visible from the Mývatn Science Station). It appeared that one or more pseudo -crater depressions had been filled with cultural deposits, a pattern reminiscent of the use of midden debris to fill natural or cultural holes and depressions seen on other sits. These discoveries led to an initial limited number of cores which indicated the presence of up to 2.5 meters of cultural deposits on the sloping surface of the Skútustaðir mound. While the LNS were not clearly seen in any core, we did encounter several apparently in situ tephra (possibly V1717 and V 1477) in several cores, and bone was recovered from cores in excellent condition. The modern family at Skútustaðir was strongly supportive of an excavation project, and a larger investigation of these promising deposits seemed clearly indicated. In 2007, the HSD grant was supplemented by the first field season of the new NABO IPY effort, and plans were made with FSÍ for an expanded cooperative excavation of the Skútustaðir midden beginning in summer 2008."

        "Text": "Just before we arrived on site, a narrow builder’s trench had been opened along the West and part of the South wall of the modern house in order to work on siding and insulation. This builder’s trench struck cultural deposits all around the house, with the deepest deposits close to the SW corner of the modern concrete house. The E-W trench extended roughly 8 m from the middle of the S wall of the house to the SW corner, and the N-S trench also ran about 8 m north of the SW corner of the house. The trench clearly intersected significant cultural deposits, as large pieces of bone (cattle, sheep, fish, bird (both swan and sea eagle) were protruding from what appeared to be rich midden deposits (ash, charcoal, turf ash) running all around the exposed “L” shaped unit, mainly concentrating at the base of the exposure. This builder’s trench has proved very useful, providing deep profiles revealing multiple tephra layers (more than any previously recorded from archaeological deposits in Mývatnssveit. The N-S builder’s trench was designated area “E 1” and the E-W trench was designated “E 2”. This area is cut by both the original construction trench of the modern house (about 50-75 cm from the wall line) and by a narrow trench cut for a water pipe connecting to the sheep house to the south. A second modern utility trench runs just east of the E2 unit. The E 2 area was extended with an approximate 2 x 2 m unit in its east end (stopping short of the second utility cut) to follow the lowermost midden deposits and to begin to bring the E2 profile into alignment with the project6"

This area was designated area “D” and a 2 X 5 m excavation unit (with a 2 x 40 cm extension to the S to follow the erosion cut) was opened and carried to the original lava rock surface. In unit D it was possible to identify and follow horizontally a dark black tephra (probably V 1717) across the whole unit.\nFurther to the East (downslope) we placed another test unit “F”, near the edge of the rim of the lowest crater, where some of the deepest cores had been recovered in 2007. This 2 x 3 m unit could not be fit to the site grid because of the orientation of the crater rim, so its precise location is probably best read from the GPS map (also see site sketch plan figure 3 below). Unit F proved to be extremely rich in 19th c deposits, and somewhat surprisingly turned up a clear structure wall near the edge of the crater rim.\n"

        "Text": "A major objective of the 2008 season was an intensive soil coring program aimed at determining maximum depth of cultural deposits (depth to sterile sub soil) and where possible some idea of stratigraphy and possible tephra deposits. While there are significant limits imposed by the field of view of a 3 cm-wide core, and detailed stratigraphic interpretation based entirely upon cores is unwise, the tube corer does provide a rapid and relatively non-destructive way of learning about deposits prior to (or in place of) excavation. The 2007 season coring runs (both scattered judgemental cores and four transects running roughly N-S and E-W) indicated that there was considerable variation in the maximum depth reached and that the natural surface appeared to be rocky volcanic lava throughout. After a few additional judgemental cores, in 2008 we set up a series of transects following the project grid (100 grid series is ~ N-S, 500 series is ~ E-W). Note that since we hit rock at base in every case, it may not always be possible to differentiate cores stopped by rocks above the maximum depth of cultural deposit, but the patterning of the results presents some clear patterns overall. Raw data is in the coring log in the Excel file in the data archive."

While any correlations between cores must be highly hypothetical, the placement of a dark tephra near the top of many core sequences does roughly correspond to the placement of the tephra tentatively identified as V 1717 in the area D unit. It does appear that (as one might expect) the clearest and most abundant tephra horizons are appearing in the deepest deposits towards the south-central portion of the apparent midden area. It would appear that this area would be a good place for a large unit allowing for better horizontal as well as vertical observation, and for the connection of plan with profile view over a large area."

Both the probable V 1717 and the V 1477 were visible in this unit, with 1717 forming a surface that could be followed across the whole unit. The 1477 tephra surface covered only the lower (inner face?) portion of the unit, and it seems that all of the midden material covering lava rock edges and spilling down the slope to the south is post medieval. The artifacts recovered (see Finds) support the view that the majority of this deposit dates between the early 18thcentury and late medieval period. Excellent bone preservation and clear stratigraphy make this a particularly valuable unit, one which has already answered several critical questions:\n1) Can tephra surfaces be followed across archaeologically meaningful distances at the Skútustaðir midden? Yes- this was possible across unit D.\n2) Is there “lateral accumulation”: progressive horizontal dumping through time as well as vertical accumulation of midden layers directly upon each other? Apparently so: the area D midden was largely between the V 1717 and V 1477 tephra, and the 15thc cultural deposits stop short of the crater rim. In area E2 nearly all the productive midden material is concentrated near the bottom of the profile on or near the Landnám tephra."

        "Text": "In area D, we can clearly follow tephra surfaces and use these to establish that (at least in this area) it was only in postmedieval times that refuse dumping (presumably from the N) topped the southern rim of the crater. Combined with the evidence for very early midden dumps in area E2 (approximately 20 m to the N), it seems plausible that there are in fact a series of only partially superposed “midden blobs” which have been used (probably intentionally) to progressively infill and smooth the rough and unattractive surface of the lava outcrop, moving more or less from N to S, uphill to downhill. Figure 10 shows the exposed lava rock of the apparent crater rim, with early modern (post 15th c) deposits topping the rock rim and running down the far side (S)."

However, the exposed profile is very deep and it was immediately recognized that multiple tephras are visible in the section- many not commonly seen on archaeological sites in Mývatnssveit. These appear to have built up in a natural hollow, perhaps on the outer (N) edge of the crater rim. There are many more tephra apparently present on N side of this rock outcrop (Profile 1 and 4) than on the south side (profile 2).\nA full analysis and description will follow from Magnus and Edinburgh, and we hope that this unusually detailed sequence may be of wide utility as well as providing an excellent framework for building the chronology of the Skútustaðir midden deposits.\n"

In the N end of E 1, the builder’s trench had fortunately left a strip of intact LNS tephra which could be followed over an area ca 50 x 75 cm (figure 12 above). Its juncture with the profile and bedding angle changes (following the dip of the natural depression to the left of the photo) could be clearly traced. A concentration of domestic mammal bone (cattle and sheep) lay directly upon the LNS, suggesting human settlement very soon after the AD 871 +/-2 ash fall."

E 2 takes in the E-W running builders’ trench, a water pipe cut, and seemed to contain a substantial scatter of animal bones. On cleaning, it appeared that intact deposits did survive over much of the E end of this trench, all lying below an extensive grey green tephra (probably V 1477 but possibly the V 940). On excavation, these deposits proved to contain rich organic deposits (including pig, goat, cattle, sheep, bird bone, marine and freshwater fish bone, & bird egg shell,). These deposits contained several non-diagnostic iron objects, a small steatite vessel sherd, and the Viking age glass double bead (see Finds below). At base, we were able to trace in a few areas patches of grey green tephra resting directly upon the rocky lava substrate (none larger than 20 sq cm).\n"

In any case, the basal midden layers in E2 infilled several natural pits, some up to 50 cm deep. Some of the basal deposits (as in Profile 1 in E1) were full of pea-sized lava gravel as well as worn animal bone fragments. We speculated that this material could possibly be spoil from a nearby excavation into the lava surface, which was then deliberately spread about to level the rough natural surface.

This area had somewhat worse drainage than the midden deposits upslope (W), and we removed several small thufur in the course of opening the unit. Area F quickly began to produce rich bone and artefact finds, many immediately identifiable as later 19c. This would appear to be one of the major dumping areas associated with the late historic turf farm building documented by Bruun only 15-20 m to the N. While the apparent 1717 tephra is visible in profile, there seems to be a major midden deposit above. Below the 1717 tephra a small turf and stone wall appeared in the N side of the unit. This may be a retaining wall of some sort, or possibly part of a pen once built into the side of the crater. We clarify and plan this wall and then temporarily finish work in F (Figure 15).\n"

There is clear evidence for occupation from first settlement in the late 9th c down to the late 19th c, with what appears to be an outstandingly complete suite of tephra. Conditions of preservation combined with the opportunity for a temporally controlled excavation of a laterally distributed midden deposit appear to provide an extremely favourable opportunity for a larger scale excavation."

        "Text": " Animal Bones\nIn areas D and F most contexts produced substantial amounts of well preserved mammal, fish, and bird bone, and egg shell concentrations were encountered regularly. In areas E 1 and E2 most bone was concentrated at the base of the profile (especially in E2). A total of 74 bags of bone were recovered, a very substantial start towards a fully quantifiable multi-period archaeofauna.\n\nWhile even a preliminary zooarchaeological assessment is best left until laboratory support is available, some field observations can be made. In area E2, both marine and freshwater fish bones were recovered (freshwater fish in some quantity) along with cattle (adult and neonatal) sheep, goat, pig (including some neonatal suckling pig bones), and birds (including at least one swan) as well as concentrations of bird egg shell. This archaeofauna certainly resembles the early materials from SVK and HRH, and the association with the Viking age bead adds to the impression of an early archaeofauna. Both the F and D units have produced substantial amounts of bone, again including both marine and freshwater fish and bird egg shell. Area F also contained several seal bones, at least two of which are definitely harp seal (Phoca groenlandica) usually associated with drift ice. Harp seal bone was also recovered from early modern contexts at Hofstaðir. It will be interesting to see if there are any documentary references to a trade in seal meat or participation by Mývatn people in the coastal seal hunt. Mandibles with intact tooth rows are being recovered from all units, suggesting that herding pattern reconstructions will be possible as sample sizes increase. Conditions of preservation (even for bird egg shell and fish bone) are excellent, with pH consistently in the 6.5 range."

Also present are small hooks, possibly from a spindle and a nice small pin. Area E1&E2 reveal earlier remains than excavated in D and F. i.e. the a Viking age bead.

        "Text": "Bead SKU 08-075 is a segmented, double bead. It is a blown bead of golden colour and is of type E130. The bead body itself is made out of colourless glass. One end of the bead is cut and the other very slightly raised. The glass is in fairly good condition although it is very mat and some of the top glass layer has eroded. Golden beads like this could be manufactured in many ways but it was most common way to achieve the golden colour was by applying a golden foil on a top of a body of a colourless glass. To seal the foil a thin layer of colourless glass was often added on top. First look indicates that this bead was only made of two layers, a colourless body and a layer of thin, golden coloured glass on top. When observed in a microscope very fine traces of what could be the golden foil could be seen in one location. \nCallmer groups together golden, blown beads of this type whether they are simple or segmented.  About 57 beads of type E130 had been found in Iceland until the end of 2004 and there of (but only 15 are segmented). About half of the beads of this type found in Iceland come from a single find, the burial at Vestdalsvatn but a small quantity also comes from other areas in the north east and  Árnessýsla. Beads of this type had, until 2005, only been found once in an excavation of a settlement (from Suðurgata in Reykjavík Suðurg. nr. 208), all the others are from heathen burials.\n Callmer does not give a chronological frame for this type of beads. They are not considered to have been made in Scandinavia but were imported, probably from the Eastern Mediterranean."

        "Text": "Ceramics and Glass by Gavin Lucas\nThe collections of ceramics and glass was small and mostly in poor condition making specific identifications difficult. As a whole however, the material spans the 17th to early 20th century and since it derives from multiple contexts, the stratigraphic sequence should be able to work well with the material to provide approximate dates for each context. \nCeramics \nA total of 83 sherds of pottery was recovered, comprising a mixture mostly of glazed red earthenwares and whitewares, but mostly not from the same contexts. The glazed red earthenwares are mostly small fragments, and most have a clear lead glaze, but a few sherds also ocurred with green glaze, but such vessels often had mixed glazes. The identifiable forms all appear to be cooking pots and include one foot of a pipkin. On the whole, these forms occur on their own and probably date from the 17th to early 19th century, but in two cases tiny fragments of whiteware also occurred ([050] and [036]), which if not intrusive, indicate a post-1800 date. From [047] came one fragment of brown salt-glazed stoneware and from [069] came more fragments of stoneware as well as some patchy glazed red earthwares as well as one whiteware plate fragment. The whitewares chiefly came from three layers: [001], [002] and [033] and include fragmets from a painted ‘peasant ware’ bowl as well as a fragment from a banded slipware and others with tissue-prints. They all suggest a date of the latter half of the 19th century. One fragment of possible chinese porcelain came from [002] and another of edge-banded european porcelain from [033]. Also from [033] came 3 sherds of an internally white-slipped orange earthenware bowl and part of a salt-glazed drain-pipe. The latter points to an early 20th century date.  \n\nGlass \nA total of 45 fragments of glass were recovered, about half being registered as window glass and half as vessel glass, though some of the window glass may be from square bottles/flasks.  Most of the glass broadly dates to the 18th-early 20th century and is green coloured, with some clear glass as well as one fragment of blue and another of amber from [033]. The sherds were small and mostly undiagnostic, but one tall-necked flared rim of a small bottle/flask came from [002] along with a fragment of a square flask/bottle. Also from layer [036] came an interesting fragment of a neck or foot of a fine table vessel with applied thread which is probably no later than 18th century and possibly earlier (i.e. 17th century). From [033] came some colourless fragments may be from a kerosene lamp chimney. A few contexts ([001], [002], [033]) also produced clear, probably machine-rolled window glass which dates to the 20th century. \nTobacco clay pipe \n12 fragments of tobacco clay pipes were identified, mostly stems, unburnished and with no markings. A small bowl fragment came from [036], but a complete one – very badly burnt – occurs in [045] and dates to the 17th century. The heel is missing and no other markings are visible."

Dating of the material was possible in the field by the presence of volcanic tephra layers dating to specific eruptions. Laboratory analysis of the tephra layers (by Jennifer Brown of Stirling University, UK) followed the field season and radiocarbon dating of bone recovered from Skutustadir was carried out at the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre (SUERC). Artifacts were also used to corroborate chronological information. \nTrench E1 & 2 was located next to the site’s modern habitation. Area E contained the following bone bearing contexts: 019, 006, 059, 063, 060. The results indicate that bone material recovered from contexts in Area E1 & 2 spanned time periods from the 9th century to the 13th and 14th centuries. The lowest layers of area E1 & 2 yielded evidence that the site had been occupied since the first settlement of Iceland in the 9th century.  "

All elements were identified as far as taxonomically possible (a selected element approach was not employed) but most mammal ribs, long bone shaft fragments and vertebral fragments were assigned to “Large Terrestrial Mammal” (cattle or horse sized) , “Medium Terrestrial Mammal” (sheep, goat, pig or large dog sized), and “Small Terrestrial Mammal” (small dog-fox sized). Only elements positively identified as Ovis aries and Capra hircus were assigned to the separate  sheep and goat categories respectively while all other sheep/goat element were assigned to the “caprine” category potentially including both sheep and goats. Digital records of all data collected were made following the 8th edition of the NABONE recording package (a Microsoft Access database supplemented with specialized Microsoft Excel spreadsheets).

This may inhibit our ability to derive information from an archaeofaunal assemblage and may impede its comparison of multiple assemblages (Lyman 1994). It is because of these factors of change that zoooarchaeological evidence is indirect evidence and an assessment of taphonomic (post death) factors is important in any analysis.\nMost bone found in middens is significantly fragmented having undergone processes such as butchery by humans, natural decay, trampling and gnawing by carnivores. Burnt bone is especially prone to fragmentation.  Specimens analyzed were classed into size categories to determine the extent of fragmentation of the assemblage.  A total sieving regime, as detailed above, often results in a collection with a high proportion of specimens in the smaller size classes."

Debris from hearth cleaning is then transferred to the midden as with other household refuse. The observed conditions of burnt bone are categorized here into three types: un-burnt bone, black burnt bone (bone in which the collagen becomes carbonized creating a black appearance), scorched bone (bone which has had brief contact with fire and heat, creating a black mottle on an otherwise un-burnt specimen), and  white burnt bone (bone which has had all of the collagen burnt away- a white, chalky, calcined appearance). Bone can become white and calcined quickly, so black and scorched bone is likely the product of only brief and non- intense contact with fire. Calcined bone is often preserved (along with teeth) even when preservation conditions are at their worst.  Poor condition for bone preservation often results in contexts containing only calcined bone and teeth. Below, burnt bone at Skutustadir is charted.  "

This included evidence of chopped bone (bone divided with a heavy impact using a sharp instrument), split bone (long bone split to expose the marrow cavity), and knifed bone (bone marked by use of a cutting tool). Culturally specific butchery signatures were noted including biperforation of metapodials which involves the creation of two holes on either end of the metapodial, allowing marrow to be extracted without otherwise fragmenting the bone. (Please refer to the NABONE manual for an extensive review of classification of butchery signatures.)\nThe past inhabitants of Skutustadir also drew on animal bone as a useful raw material and may have worked bone and horn on site.  Several diverse examples of worked bone were present in the assemblage including a drilled cow astragalus, a sheep and cow metapodial shaped and oriented with the former inside the later, as well as an item made of smoothed cetacean bone (whale or porpoise bone).  Evidence of horn working was recovered in the form of both horn core fragments (of caprines and cows) and skull fragments showing evidence of intentional horn removal taking place after the animal’s death."

        "Text": "Subsistence \nPrevious studies have suggested that caprines and cattle traditionally comprised Icelandic farms. The study of the age at death of these animals as well as the ratio of caprines to cattle has lent further complexity to the subject, allowing for a more detailed discussion of economic motives (McGovern et al. 2007). In Iceland’s past, both caprines and cattle were consumed for meat while caprines were also kept for wool and cattle for extensive dairying activities (for a complete discussion on the use of zoooarchaeological evidence in determining herding strategies see Payne (1973) and Halstead (1998). For more information on the results from other Icelandic excavations, please see the reports available at www.nabohome.org). Both wool and dairy were of central economic importance and could be used as currency, i.e. in payment of tithes (Karlsson 2000: pp 50 & 244).\nWhere wool is central to the economy of a particular site, caprines are mostly seen to be slaughtered during adulthood, maximizing their wool production per individual. Previous zoooarchaeological studies have hypothesized that in the late Medieval Period, an increase in trade of monetized wool products parallels the increase in numbers of caprines vs cattle in Icelandic domestic stocks (McGovern 2007).  Preliminarily, it appears that there may be an increase over time in the caprine to cattle ratio at Skutustadir. The later contexts showed a high caprine to cattle ratio however larger sample numbers recovered in the upcoming 2009 season will be beneficial in confirming or negating this preliminary view.\nWhere cattle-based dairying is important, a large proportion of neonatal cattle bone is found in an archaeological assemblage. By keeping cows in calf-bearing cycles, they continuously produce milk and calves for human consumption (Halstead 1998). On the other hand, in a cattle economy based solely on meat production, cattle are slaughtered when they reach prime age and mature body size. Based on the archaeofauna collected in the 2008 field season, there is sufficient evidence that past residents of Skutustadir were practicing a dairy economy.  In some contexts, nearly half of the cattle bones recovered are those of newborn calves (see chart below).\nIn contrast to the high number of neonatal cattle per adult cattle, only 18 total NISP of neonatal caprines were documented from the entire assemblage, across all contexts.  This may demonstrate separate herding strategies as well as separate economic uses for cattle and caprines.\nFurther description of the herding strategies employed by the Skutustadir residents will be reserved for the full zoooarchaeological laboratory report which will follow this report and will include size and age reconstructions based on bone metrics as well as analyses of mandibular tooth eruption and wear (following von den Dreisch 1976 and Grant 1982)."

It is possible that past residents took advantage of this nearby resource to keep ample herds of cattle as well.  An isotopic study of N15 present in cow and caprine bone from Skutustadir is planned to explore the hypothesis of separate caprine and cattle grazing land. A second important component of the planned study will examine mandibular tooth wear which may indicate whether caprines regularly grazed in pasture with higher content of grit (following Grant 1982) when compared to cattle tooth wear. For a quantifiable sample, it will be necessary to recover more mandibles of both species in the 2009 excavation season at Skutustadir. "

Another present avian species was ptarmigan (Lagopus mutus), a local terrestrial species. Marine avian species were not found in the assemblage. Bird egg shell was found but will require analysis at the micro-level in order to determine the species. Bird egg shell found at other lake Myvatn sites has pointed to a long term tradition of sustainable harvest of bird eggs, beginning in the 9 centuries and still carried out today (McGovern et al 2007). The presence of a variety of local birds in the midden suggests that the harvesting of local birds as food was not focused on a single local species.  "

Madsen with additional work by Aldred in 2009). The LoS program has greatly improved our understanding of the timing and processes of the Viking age Landnám in Iceland, and the value of multiple sites of different social status and local environment tied together by the isochrones provided by the critical V871 and V940 tephra has been clearly demonstrated. The strategy of a long term commitment to research in a single district and the “longitudinal” perspective provided has become a key element in the research agenda of Historical Ecology and Human Ecodynamics, and the LoS is now one of several similar landscape-scaled investigations in the region. In many respects, Mývatnssveit is now one of the most intensively researched and best documented portions of the Norse North Atlantic, and one of a very few Viking Age multi-site cultural landscapes now known anywhere."

In 2006 we began a cooperative project under the Human and Social Dynamics of Global Change program of US NSF led by Astrid Ogilvie (HSD: Human and Social Dynamics in Mývatnssveit, Iceland, from the Settlement to the Present) aimed at connecting the archaeological record with the historical documents for land use and landscape change with interviews with senior farmers in the district."

        "Text": "The archaeology team has been tasked with locating midden deposits contemporary with the historical data sets, and to support the overall objectives of connecting more distant past with the present. In 2006 we did locate early modern deposits at Hofstaðir and Narfastaðir, but failed to locate the large and continuous midden deposits needed to link to the large Viking Age collections. In 2007, a larger scale survey project aimed at locating and testing middens (using soil corers and small test trenches) was carried out under the leadership of Orri Vésteinsson with the aim of locating deeper midden deposits extending from recent times to the medieval period (Vésteinsson ed. 2008). The 2007 survey located and tested middens at multiple sites (Beinistaðir, Hofstaðir, Graenavatn, Geirastaðir, Litla Gotland, Thorleifstaðir, Baldursheimar,  Grímstaðir) but the key discovery of the 2007 season was made by Arni Einarsson, who observed a patch of erosion at the southern edge of the green field behind the modern farm and church area at Skútustaðir had exposed a patch of well preserved mammal and fish bones (the site is clearly visible from the Mývatn Research Station). It appeared that one or more pseudo crater depressions had been filled with cultural deposits, a pattern reminiscent of the use of midden debris to fill natural or cultural holes and depressions seen on other sits. These discoveries led to test cores which indicated the presence of up to 2.5 meters of cultural deposits on the sloping surface of the Skútustaðir mound. While the LNS were not clearly seen in any core, we did encounter several apparently in situ tephra (possibly V1717 and V 1477) in several cores, and bone was recovered from cores in excellent condition. The modern family at Skútustaðir was strongly supportive of an excavation project, and a larger investigation of these promising deposits seemed clearly indicated.  In 2007, the HSD grant was supplemented by the first field season of the new NABO IPY effort supported by NSF OPP Arctic Social Sciences Program, and an expanded cooperative excavation of the Skútustaðir midden began in summer 2008 (see Edwald & McGovern 2008, Edwald 2009, Hicks and Harrison 2009). The 2008 investigations were extremely productive and provided both a very useful initial archaeofauna (Hicks in Edwald 2009, Hicks and Harrison 2009), archaeobotanical samples (Church in Edwald 2009) and artifacts datable to both Viking age and the 17th c AD. A suite of AMS Radiocarbon dates (provided by Gordon Cook of SUERC) and an unusually large number of volcanic tephra layers have provided an internally consistent chronology (see Edwald 2009), and thanks to the isochrones provided by the major tephra layers (esp. V1717, V1477, H 1300, and V c 940 and V 871) it has been possible to tie together widely separated parts of the site."

The single AMS date  SUERC 20219 on this fill suggests a late 10th c date for this infilling (above the mid-10th c V940 tephra), at least in the area E portion of the rocky outcrop. The use of this sort of mix of gravel and midden material to in fill and level out the very uneven and deeply fissured surface of the Skútustaðir  natural lava outcrop was to be encountered on a much larger scale at the base of Unit G in the 2009 season."

        "Text": "Zooarchaeology 2008:  The 2008 excavations produced a substantial archaeofauna (total number of fragments 16,614), which was divided into a set of six preliminary phases based on the stratigraphy and radiocarbon chronology available from the 2008 season. Most of the 2008 archaeofauna came from the early modern period (ca. 1500-1850) and derived from the D and F units, with smaller medieval archaeofauna being recovered from the E 1 and E 2 profiles, and less than a hundred bones from the Viking Age deposits ( see Table 1 below  from Hicks & Harrison 2009).  A major trend in the 2008 archaeofauna was an increase in the relative proportions of caprines (sheep or goat, here nearly all sheep) relative to cattle in the early modern period and a persistent dairy management profile in the cattle (high % of young calves). Both are trends apparent in other Mývatnssveit sites, but at present Skútustaðir is unique in maintaining a ca 5:1 caprine to cattle ratio into the early modern period (other archaeofauna show ratios nearer 20 : 1). This has remained a successful dairy farm down to the present, probably due in part to access to excellent wet meadows of the Framengjar nearby.                                                                                                                                                                          The 2008 excavations at Skútustaðir thus produced substantial collections of datable materials and confirmed the potential of these deeply stratified midden deposits and associated multiple tephra layers. It also resulted in a detailed site map created by Oscar Aldred with high resolution GPS and allowed for collection of geoarchaeology samples ( Ian Simpson, Val DeFeu, and Jennifer Brown) and palaeoentomological samples (Veronique Forbes) and a systematic soil coring survey (at 5 and 1 m intervals) that covered most of the potential excavation area. The 2008 effort thus left us in a good position to expand excavation units and increase sample recovery from increasingly well understood deposits. The success of the 2009 season thus owes a great deal to the hard work of the 2008 crews."

This gave us an initial working area of 21 sq meters which we named Unit “G”.  This unit was placed over 2008 soil cores that appeared to show deep stratigraphy and some tephra horizons, and was connected to the east side of the 2008 Unit D in an effort to connect the stratigraphic profiles and effectively combine the 2008 and 2009 phasing. Unit D had ended with its eastward end just getting below the V 1477 tephra, and we hoped that earlier periods would be represented further down slope."

We speculate that this area may have collected a refuse stream largely from floor cleaning episodes of the large turf house prior to its demolition, and we may be seeing some segregation of relatively “clean” fill from the deposits down slope to the south and east, which are rich in larger bones and artifacts."

        "Text": "Since a major objective of the 2009 season was recovery of well stratified animal bone and the early modern layers in Unit G continued to be poor in large bones and artifacts, we put in a small 2 x 2 m test unit H just to the east (downslope) of Unit G to investigate bone and artefact density in this area. We immediately encountered masses of well preserved bones and large artifacts. We thus decided to expand Unit H, initially into a 2 x 5 meter unit running E-W (across the slope) that connected directly to the Unit G south profile (on the 500 E-W  grid line). By the end of the season we had expanded the Unit G area to a full 4 x 5 m unit which continued to be amazingly productive of bones and artifacts.  As we expanded the excavation unit down slope, it became apparent that what had seemed to be the edge of an infilled pseudo-crater was more likely simply a break in slope that had become covered with successive layers of midden deposit- the actual bedrock in the area is still far below according to coring results.  It appears that we may be seeing deposits on a fissured lava ridge (which continues to the north of the grassy infilled area nearer the farm complex) rather than into a regular rounded pseudocrater. Also apparent was the sustained pattern of “dumping over the edge” of the plateau formed by earlier infilling of the lava ridge south of the main farmyard area, as we encountered a deposit of mid-20th c debris (early soda bottles and parts of a sheet metal water heater) near the surface, with 19th, 18th, and 17th c deposits directly beneath. It would appear that there has been a sustained pattern of infilling the nearer parts of the ridge (which is now part of the regularly mowed infield of the farm) with “clean fill” from house interior cleaning (and in the 20th c with the major demolition spread of the old turf farmhouse) and the deposit of larger (unsightly and probably smelly) debris over the edge of the ridge to the south and east.  This use of midden material for landscaping and extension of home field area has been observed at other sites in Iceland and Greenland, but it seems likely that the extent of infilling and remodeling of land surface at Skútustaðir will be exceptional as we come to more fully understand its temporal and spatial patterning."

Only 20 cm below the 1477 tephra we began to encounter a deposit rich in large mammal bones and comprised of a looser deposit with small lava stones and lava gravel mixed in with the many animal bones, bird egg shell, fire cracked rocks, and charcoal fragments (Figure 10 below).\nThis deposit resembled other Viking Age middens in Mývatnssveit, and proved to be associated with two 9th -10th c tephra- the V c 940 tephra and the Landnám sequence (V 871). This bone rich deposit rests directly upon the V 871 LNS, which could be traced widely across the unit, but it appears to also be just above or mixed with the later V 940 tephra and is probably mid-10 c in date; perhaps contemporary with the late 9th c fill in Area E1 across the home field. This early midden dump seems to have been largely restricted to the south end of the unit, and was packed into the many crevices and fissures associated with a major lava rock fissure that runs approximately east-west down the slope (Figure 11 below).  This seems to have been a rapid infilling event (some long bones were standing vertically when excavated, indicating a dense packing during deposit) which appears in a similar stratigraphic position to the much smaller infilling observed in profile E 1 in 2008 (Figure 2 above). It would appear that sometime in the mid 10th c there was sufficient labor, midden material, and desire to conduct some major landscaping of what must have been initially a fairly hostile lava ridge line fissured with cracks and sharp edged depressions and holes. This represents one more challenge to the notion of a gradual and small scale settlement of the Mývatn area, suggesting substantial human presence in the first generations of settlement after ca AD 871.  A small feature probably representing the edge of a hearth built directly upon the LNS tephra appeared below this 10 c fill in the NE corner of Unit G (Figure 12)."

The Unit G area was fully backfilled (sandbags were inserted into the open lava pits and caves to prevent collapse) but Unit H was left partially backfilled under a cover of barrier cloth."

        "Text": "At the end of the 2009 season we had taken the expanded Unit H down to the surface of a previously undocumented tephra layer (which must date to the early 17th c on the basis of associated pipe stems and other objects). This tephra (between the 1717 and 1477 tephra) has been tentatively identified in geological sections dug by Ian Simpson’s team further south in the interior Kráká river drainage and awaits fuller characterization.  Major collections of artifacts and well preserved bone were made in the 17th c layers of the Unit H excavation unit, and these showed some visible differences from the now-familiar Mývatn Viking age (more seal bones, many large fish heads as well as post-cranial bones, many more imported objects).  The 2009 season was very successful in recovering large archaeofauna from the early modern period (esp. 17th c) and the Viking Age, with over 300 bags of bone registered. The large open area exposures certainly allowed us a better understanding of the history of deposition and landscape alteration at this major site and the strategy of stratigraphic stripping down of deposits proved practical and successful (and was greatly aided by tephra horizons). We did not recover a continuous stratigraphic record from 20th c to Landnám, as patterns of midden deposition seem to have shifted over the homefield area over the centuries and medieval deposits were not well represented in the main Unit G area. However, we are steadily gaining a better understanding of horizontal and vertical partitioning of this extensive deposit, and the 2010 project season should be well positioned to extend our temporal coverage. The Skútustaðir midden deposits continue to represent a major resource for Iceland’s historical and environmental heritage."

        "Text": "Introduction \nThe discovery of an intact midden at Skútustaðir’s historic farmstead in 2007 was a key finding for the planned investigation of the medieval and early modern periods in the lake Mývatn area of northern Iceland. The 2009 field season followed a soil coring survey and surface collection in 2007 and the excavation of four test trenches in 2008. Work was carried out by international team of archaeologists (hailing from the City University of New York (CUNY), North Atlantic Biocultural Organization (NABO) Fornleifastofnun Islands(FSÍ) and the University of Bradford) as part of an ongoing National Science Foundation, International Polar Year (NSF, IPY) project focusing on long term subsistence practices and human and environmental interactions. Zooarchaeological evidence from Skútustaðir excavation seasons in 2008 and 2009 is reviewed in this report, and laboratory analysis of animal bones is ongoing at the CUNY Hunter College and CUNY Brooklyn College Zooarchaeology Laboratories.  The  ongoing analysis has shown that the most important domesticates were sheep and cattle- used for meat, wool. and dairy throughout all periods.  Skútustaðir may have had some advantages in their ability to keep cattle over other farms in the area. Goats, pigs, and horses are also present in the archaeofauna in low numbers. The presence of birds, bird egg shell, seals, cetaceae (whales and porpoises), marine fish and freshwater fish points toward a breadth of local and non local resources being consumed at the site. Ongoing analysis aims to uncover the diets and economies of the site’s residents as well as the related social and ecological interactions through time."

Orri Vésteinsson and Adolf Friðriksson of the Archaeological Institute of Iceland (FSÍ) Orri Vessteinsson lead the 2007 excavation and coring regime with the purpose of establishing the archaeological potentials of  additional farms in an area that had been intensively investigated since 1991 as part of the Landscapes of Settlement Project and the Human and Social Dynamics in Mývantssveit Project (Vésteinsson ed 2008). \nUntil 2008, the large scale excavations in the area (Hofstaðir, Sveigakot and Hrísheimar) had illuminated the nature of settlement,  economy and ecology of the settlement period (ca 870- 1000 AD) and a portion of the medieval period (ca 1000 through the 13th century AD) (for more information on the above excavations see McGovern et al 2007).  Through the coring survey, a team of CUNY archaeologists lead by Orri Vésteinsson hoped to find archaeological sites that would contribute to our understanding of long term, post- Viking settlement in the Mývatn area- i.e. sites that included archaeological remains dating to the medieval and early modern periods (ca 1000 AD through the 18th century AD).  \nThe extensive coring survey of Skútustaðir focused on three promising areas: Area A was cluster of possible structural remains on the high point of the site; Area B, a steep slope southeast of area A, and downslope and pond-side Area C called “Oskutangi” or ash peninsula-  possibly indicating a historic rubbish disposal area (McGovern in Vésteinsson 2008).  Area B proved to yield the best results for the presence of deep midden deposits- prefaced by a surface collection carried out by Arni Einarsson of the Mývatn science station- the coring survey found there to be extensive midden material with very good preservation. The following year, test trenches would be excavated to explore the extent, preservation and temporality of the midden and to obtain a collection of animal bone and artifacts for analysis."

The results of the coring survey by Frank Feeley and George Hambrecht showed the midden to occupy a massive area and pointed to the impressive archaeological potential of the  site. The zooarchaeological report of the following summarized analysis (post-2008) is available online at www.nabohome.org (Hicks and Harrison 2009).  Following the field season, radiocarbon dating of bone recovered from Skútustaðir was done by Drs. Gordon Cook and Philippa Ascough at the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre (SUERC) and the results are presented in the table below.\nThese results (from terrestrial mammal bone) were of great help where tephrachronology was not fully resolved, and the results, along with the clear presence of the V 1477 tephra and V 1717 tephra among cultural layers firmly established the long term inhabitation of Skútustaðir. Tephrachronology and radiocarbon dating have allowed us to group our stratigraphic contexts in the following phases (only stratigraphic contexts bearing bone and so far analyzed are listed here):"

Trench G was excavated down to the natural lava surface while still there remains approximately 1 meter depth of cultural material to excavate in 2010. The ground surface below the remaining material is very uneven so it is difficult to predict the actual depth of the deposits.

Following the arrival of additional material from the 2009 field season, in November 2009, analysis was completed of the entirety of the mammal bones from large, 10th c. context [161] which produced 28 bags of bone. This archaeological layer was an extremely bone rich midden mixed with gravel that was deposited directly on the lava surface at some point during the earliest phase of settlement of Skútustaðir. It was associated with the 10th century V940 volcanic tephra and likely dates closely to this time. The layer appeared to be an intentional in-filling of a fissure in the craggy, once bare lava surface.  This inhospitable surface, exposed before human settlement, has been augmented by 1000 years of midden deposition to be a rich and productive infield for the farm.  Context [161] would have represented the initiation of this project, the direct deposition of bone and household debris onto the rough lava bedrock. The excellent level of preservation of the context was observable immediately in the field and as a result, it was the first priority for laboratory analysis.\nThe above images depict the craggy lava surface with in-filled context [161] in the process of excavation and after excavation of the bone- rich deposit down to the natural lava surface. The nicely banded midden is visible in the photographed profiles. The profile drawing below depicts the location of context [161] a portion of the west facing profile of area G, behind the excavators in the photograph.\nDuring excavation, the following measures were taken in accordance with NABO and FSÍ recommendations to ensure excellent recovery of faunal material and other artifacts the field: all midden material bearing bone was dry-sieved through 4mm mesh. Regular checking of the resulting back-dirt suggests that few elements were missed by the sieving methods. All articulated elements and in situ clusters of bird egg shell fragments were placed in one bag or in bulk soil samples in the field and subsequently recorded as one specimen to reduce interdependence.  Thorough recovery of the faunal material was further ensured through the careful excavation by several team members with previous zooarchaeological training."

Analysis of the fish bones recovered in 2008 and 2009 will be carried out at the Brooklyn College and the Hunter College Zooarchaeological Laboratories. All elements (bird and mammal) were identified as far as taxonomically possible (a selected element approach was not employed) but most mammal ribs, long bone shaft fragments and vertebral fragments were assigned to “Large Terrestrial Mammal” (cattle or horse sized), “Medium Terrestrial Mammal” (sheep, goat, pig or large dog sized), and “Small Terrestrial Mammal” (small dog-fox sized). Only elements positively identified as Ovis aries and Capra hircus were assigned to the separate sheep and goat categories respectively while all other sheep/goat element were assigned to the “caprine” category potentially including both sheep and goats. Digital records of all data collected were made following the 98th edition of the NABONE recording package (a Microsoft Access database supplemented with specialized Microsoft Excel spreadsheets). The animal bones excavated will be permanently curated at the National Museum of Iceland. This report, other reports and data are available from nabo@voicenet.com and the NABO website: www.nabohome.org.\nCuration followed the NABONE protocols followed for other archaeofauna from Iceland, Faroes, Greenland, and northern Norway (NABONE, 2004, see www.nabohome.org for downloadable version 9). Following widespread North Atlantic tradition, bone fragment quantification makes use of the Number of Identified Specimens (NISP) method (Grayson 1984). Mammal measurements (with a Mituyo Digimatic caliper) followed the approach outlined by von den Driesch (1976), and sheep/goat distinctions follow Boessneck, (1969) and Halstead and Mainland (2005).

        "Text": "Taphonomy\nThe physical condition of bone transforms multiple times during its journey from a living animal to a laboratory specimen through decay, fragmentation and other processes. This may inhibit our ability to derive information from an archaeofaunal assemblage and may impede its comparison of multiple assemblages (Lyman 1994). On the other hand, the processes that bone has undergone leave traces that contribute to our understanding of human activity at a given archaeological site, such as butchery or burning. It is because of these factors of change that zoooarchaeological evidence is indirect evidence and an assessment of taphonomic (post death) factors is key to any analysis. \nMost bone found in middens is significantly fragmented, and burnt bone is especially prone to fragmentation.  Specimens analyzed were classed into size categories to determine the extent of fragmentation of the assemblage.  A total sieving regime, as detailed above, often results in a collection with a high proportion of specimens in the smaller size classes and thus, the unidentifiable classes. Where in some cases, a high percentage of small fragments signals poor preservation, in this case where total sieving through fine 4mm mesh is used, it is the result of thorough recovery practices."

        "Text": "The taphonomy of context [161] is unusual for Icelandic midden deposits. The first and most noticeable difference between the layer and others is that it contained an extremely low percentage of burnt bones relative to other sites.  Analysis of all bird and mammal bones from 2008 demonstrates a levels of burnt bone between 10 and 40 percent. Burnt bone fragments readily, contributing to such high numbers. Context [161], however contained only .005% burnt bone or 21 specimens burnt and 4342 un-burnt. This contrasts with other findings where Icelandic settlement period deposits (ca 870-1000 AD) contained more burnt bone that later deposits (Bigelow 1985).  \nAnother anomaly was the presence in context [161] of a large amount of coprolites- likely dog coprolytes, as well as gnawed bone and partially digested bone. These traces not only point to the presence of dogs but also to a moderate level of disturbance of the faunal collection that we must take into account. Overall, though evidence of the presence of dogs is common, the intensity of gnawing expressed in % of gnawed specimens seems to be relatively low when compared through phases.\nButchery of bones in context [161] was common at levels seen in other Icelandic sites. However, this mammal rich collection, with good preservation allowed for some additional observations of butchery patterns. Several patterns emerged as evidence of regular manners of carcass disarticulation- this included innominates that were frequently chopped and severed distal humeri. This points to a pattern of expedient disarticulation where people were probably using heavy chopping tools to sever the bone, as opposed to attempting to dismember a joint by removing flesh alone, which would be hampered by thick areas of tendons and ligaments. There were several examples of heavily chopped vertebras, both caprine and of cattle. While heavily chopped cervical vertebra seen at the site of Hofstaðir pointed (with other behaviors) toward feasting-related ritual sacrifice and consumption of cattle (McGovern in Lucas ed. 2009), at least one vertebra observed at Skútustaðir, in 10th c context [161] were clearly chopped from the ventral side of the animal, suggesting again an expedient manner of dismemberment.  Such patterns demonstrate how the sites residents would break down a carcass into manageable, smaller parts. Other butchery patterns included removal of horns from skulls of caprines and cattle, most likely for horn working; splitting of caprine skulls to access the brain as food (a preparation called svið); as well as the very regular dividing of the mandible between of the last present molar and the ascending ramus which was likely done for tongue extraction. All bones of the axial and apendicular skeleton were present in the midden suggesting that butchery, consumption, and disposal occurred on site- in contrast to outside provisioning which sometimes leaves more narrow categories of species and elements as remnants. Very surprisingly, there were few fish bones present in the 10th c. context [161]- out of 28 bags of faunal remains, there are merely a few handfuls of fish bones. Immediately visible were several Haddock cleithra and several salmonid vertebra. The fish bones from Skútustaðir will be analyzed in the Brooklyn College Zooarchaeology laboratory.

        "Text": "The composition of context [161] is unusual when compared to most Icelandic midden layers.   During excavation it was noted to be unusually bone rich. Bones were packed into this once lava crevice without the normally very predominant inclusion of slowly accreting dumps of ash, fireplace cleaning debris, floor cleaning debris and other discard which normally compose Icelandic midden layers.  Excavators noted bones not only densely packed, but also standing and laying at angles against the lava surface and other bone. In contrast, slow successive discard events of bone normally result in bones laying on a ground surface at the same angle as that surface.  The lack of large numbers of fish bone, which tend to be small, and burnt bones, which tend also to be small and breakable, may indicate that the bones deposited in context [161] were hand-collected and placed there in a rapid depositional event possibly to in-fill the crevice in the lava surface.  A similarly dense, perhaps rapid accumulation of bone was observed during the excavation of the settlement age farm Hrísheimar in an area called pithouse C.  The unusual formation of context [161] illustrates how the formation of middens can result from general or habitual human activities like successive cleanings and dumping or unique practices where refuse is put into use by people for shaping and changing their living environments.\nContext [161] is compared to other 10th century assemblages from the Lake Mývatn Area (information is courtesy of The NABO & NORSEC Laboratories.  For further detailed information please see reports archived on NABOHOME.org).  Hofstaðir is a high status site in nearby in the Laxa river valley and Sveigakot is a relatively high elevation site south of Skutustaðir; both sites were initially settled during the Viking age and are indicated on the map on page 3 of this report. The surprisingly small number of fish bones found in context [161] is well-illustrated by this chart. The use of birds seems to have been variable by site in the 10th century. Seals and cetacean species are absent in the data represented here.  "

        "Text": "Domestic Mammals \nCaprines and cattle clearly dominate the domestic fauna assemblages throughout all ages. Previous zoooarchaeological studies have suggested that in Northern Icelandic farms, after ca. 1200 AD, there is a pronounced increase in numbers of caprines when compared to cattle in Icelandic stocks (McGovern 2007, Brewington et al 2004).  Preliminary results of Skutustadir’s archaeofauna suggest that there is at first a decrease in the number of caprines kept per cattle through time, with the fewest sheep per cattle being kept in the middle ages, followed by an increase over time in the caprine to cattle ratio at Skútustaðir- reaching 5 caprines per every head of cattle in the early modern period. These numbers of sheep per cattle are all comparatively low however when we look at some nearby examples.  The 13th c. evidence from the site of Steinbogi (Brewington et al 2004) shows that the caprine to cattle ratio reaches approximately 22:1. Furthermore, the 18th century farm inventory (Jardabok) describes Mývatn area farms as having approximately 24 caprines per cattle at the time it was written. As a third example, the Viking age high status site of Hofstaðir maintained approximately 4:1 caprine to cattle ratio from 9301050 CE (McGovern in Lucas ed. 2009). The lower status site of Sveigakot transitioned from a 3:1 caprine to calttle ratio to a 10:1 ratio from the late 9th c to the 11th c.  Skútustaðir’s archaeofaunal record may suggest that farmers there were apart from the trend of an extreme increase in sheep per cattle going into the high medieval period and continuing through the early modern period."

        "Text": "The study of cattle and caprine holdings through time in the Lake Mývatn Area has important implications for an area where the landscape has been significantly impacted by humans and their livestock (McGovern et al 2007). Through archaeological investigation, it has been revealed that the area was subject to extensive deforestation and then extensive erosion which was crippling if not deleterious to farms in the area (Dugmore et al 2005, McGovern et al 2007).  In both cases, the application of caprines to the land appears to have played a role.   \nHalstead has argued that where cattle-based dairying has occurred, a large proportion of neonatal cattle bone is found in an archaeological assemblage (1998). By keeping cows in calf bearing cycles while culling the calves, cows continuously produce milk and calves for human consumption. On the other hand, in a cattle economy based solely on meat production, cattle are slaughtered when they reach mature body size.  \nNeonatal bone is identified by a variety of traits including size, shape, porosity, state of fusion of long bone epiphyses, tooth eruption stage (where possible), and extensive use of comparative neonatal specimens. The archaeofauna collected in the 2008 field season suggest that past residents of Skútustaðir were killing of many young calves and were likely practicing a dairy economy to some extent.  In some contexts, nearly half of the cattle bones recovered are those of newborn calves (see chart below). The proportion of neonatal cattle being killed off appears to decrease in the late medieval to early modern period. It may be best to reserve final conclusions until more specimens are recovered in the following excavations of Skútustaðir."

It is believed that horses were not eaten approximately after the Christianization of Iceland around 1000 CE as Icelanders increasingly adopted alternate customs alongside their new religion (Karlsson 2000, p. 46). Horse burials have been well documented in Iceland which may suggest that horse specimens will not commonly be found in household middens. \nDuring the settlement period and at least into the 10th c., pig husbandry was more common than in later periods (McGovern et al 2007).  The 10th c. context from Skútustaðir [161] contained eleven pig specimens: seven metapodials, one third phalanx (hoof), one first phalanx, one tibia, and one tooth. Of the phalanges, metapodials and tibia, (total 10 specimens)- only two were fully fused which may indicate that the residents of Skútustaðir preferred to consume young pigs.  As analysis continues, we hope to contextualize a larger data set of pig remains among other evidence of pig husbandry in the north Atlantic as only 13 specimens of pig remains have been found at the site so far."

        "Text": "Domestic Mammal Tooth Rows\nThe eruption and wear stages of teeth in an archaeofaunal collection can help us establish more precisely the age at death of animals present. As a group, this information may convey a “kill-off pattern”. The broad literature on this topic is aimed at determining the specific stock management strategies applied by herders (Payne 1973, Driesch 1985, Munro 2004, Mainland and Halsted 2005). The meaning of kill of patterns (i.e. how they relate to peoples economic, dietary and other social motives) is highly specific to environmental and economic contexts Demands of a market (consumers) can dictate kill-off patterns as well as notions of efficiency applied by the herder (Payne 1973). Seasonality of birth, seasonality of plant growth, winter, or drought can also play a role in timing and age of kill-off patterns (Driesch 1985). Production of hides, wool, meat, and dairy products can all contribute to different culling strategies, thus, there is no one-to-one universal correlation between age- at- death patterns and specific economic strategies, but local hypotheses should be investigated and ethnographic information is helpful. \nThough management strategies are highly specific to their culture and environment, general knowledge regarding livestock development and age is useful. Sebastian Payne’s work in Asvan Turkey suggests that a kill off pattern focusing on efficient meat production (from sheep), might include a majority of animals killed around 18-30 months of age, as this is when they reach their full size there (1973). Additional feed and pasturage need not be dedicated to their growth as returns would not increase (Payne 1973). Icelandic studies have suggested that caprines reared there reach their maximum body size between 3.5 and 4.5 years of age (Harrison et al 2008). \nKill-off patterns with large number of lambs can indicate a preference for lamb meat (Dreisch (1985), dairying practice (Halstead 1998), hardship and disease, or herd size management.  Worldwide, a limitless variety of desired products might influence kill off patterns; using information from historical and archaeological literature in Iceland and the greater Norse north Atlantic (Halstead 1998, Mainland and Halstead 2005, McGovern 2009), we can focus on a few specific hypotheses concerning the economic motives that formed the age-at- death patterns in our archaeofauna from Skutustadir .  \nTooth eruption stages can provide very detailed data on age. Each mandible’s teeth has a range of ages at which it emerges, erupts, wears away due to grit content of food, and if deciduous, falls out. \nThere are a number of qualitative ways of calculating age via eruption and tooth wear (See Grant 1982, See also Hillson 1986 (Appendix B) which displays dental eruption stages for sheep and goats). \nVery complex data sets can be derived from this qualitative data, and sometimes overlapping qualitative criteria and qualitative values expressed in ranges (such as ages of eruption per tooth) can be daunting.  The following evaluation looks only at mandibular teeth, and is interested in specifically defined age classes, which are exclusive, and are defined here based on what previous literature suggest may be relevant (this analysis follows McGovern, personal communication, and Harrison 2008). Then, considers this data in relation to what it may indicate about age at death and further, herd management. By using eruption rather than wear stage, we hope to temporarily circumvent methods that age animals using wear stage while we study how they may be best applicable in Icelandic contexts. The age categories devised for this interim assessment are as follows: \nCaprines\nNewborn - deciduous premolar 4 (dp4) is unworn\n<3 months – dp4 worn only\n5-6 months – dp4 + first molar (M1) are present\n15-18 months – dp4 + M1 + second molar (M2) present \n>24-30 months – P4 or M3 (third molar) have erupted and have been worn"

        "Text": "Peoples past use of upland summer pastures could also provide a reason for the lack of young caprines at being killed- off the farmstead site. Caprines are ethnographically known to have been managed to have a birthing season in Iceland in May, when more food soon becomes available in at the inception of the growing season. Further, farmers in this area were known to graze their sheep in the upland pastures- where additional vegetation is available for a shorter time- during the summer and to have dwellings (sels) there for community members to supervise their stocks, and to harvest secondary products such milk.  This may mean that the youngest sheep would be found in upland pastures, having been born there or immediately relocated there from the farmstead shortly after birth. It may be helpful to compare an archaeofauna from a summer upland pasture dwelling to see if the age-at –death information is different there- including more young sheep.  The question of the lack of young sheep being killed off at the farmstead may be a question of an emphasis on wool production as described above, but also the  seasonal movement of caprines and their birthing patterns- it is a possibility which may be addressed in the future by comparing data sets of age-at death patterns between upland sels and lowland farmsteads."

        "Text": "Dental morphology measurements were taken on from caprine mandibles following von den Driesch (1976), with an interest in the possibility that domestic caprine stocks may have undergone “breed improvements” such as this described by Thomas in his 2005 work, “Zooarchaeology, Improvement and the British Agricultural Revolution”.  Thomas suggests that economic and social transformations may have co-evolved with incentives and abilities of British farmers to breed larger stocks as early as the fourteenth century (2005). We wonder if this trend of people managing sheep for enlargement is present in the Icelandic archaeological record.  \nThe eventual goals for this data include a multi site comparison through time, to evaluate whether dental morphology (and body size) of caprines has changed over time in Iceland. The small data presented here include the mandibles on which it was possible to measure the fourth premolar (P4) through the third molar (M3).  The measurable mandibles come from three phases of the site’s occupation: the 10th century, 1477-1717, and Post 1717. After further ongoing analysis, it will be possible to include more mandibles from Skútustaðir and we hope to further contextualize them among numerous Icelandic (and north Atlantic) sites and time periods.   \nPreliminarily, it appears there may be a shift toward longer mandibular tooth rows when mandibular tooth row measurements from the 10th century are compared with those from latter periods. This might reflect larger individuals over all. Whether this pattern is real and relates to “breed improvement” as Thomas describes it (2005) is premature to conclude without more work to uncover additional contextual information and of course, a larger sample size. Thomas asserts that there is great potential for metrical, zooarchaeological data in addressing the questions surrounding stock “improvement”, and a preliminary look at this data (though a small sample) suggests that as the set grows, it may yield significant results."

        "Text": "Birds\nBird species found throughout the site include mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), red breasted merganser (Mergus serrator), scaup (Aythya marilla), swans (Cygnus sp.), swan/goose sized specimens, slavonian grebe (Auritus podiceps), long-tailed ducks (Clangula hyemalis) and one specimen of gull (Larus sp).  Another present avian species was ptarmigan (Lagopus mutus), a local terrestrial bird. One sea eagle claw (Haliatus albicilla) was found in an unstratified context.  \nBird egg shell was found but will require analysis at the micro-level in order to be identified to a species level. Bird egg shell previously found in other lake Mývatn archaeofauna has pointed to a long term tradition of sustainable harvest of bird eggs, beginning in the 9 centuries and still carried out today (McGovern et al 2007). The presence of a variety of local (non marine) birds in the midden suggests that the harvesting of local birds as food was not focused on a single local species.  \nDuring the 2009 excavation season, very dense, but thin, layers of fragmented bird egg shell were found in the midden. Because the fragments would be too small to be recovered in the sieve, they were sub-sampled directly into small bags or into the soil samples that will be screened through fine mesh and sorted.  Their stratigraphic relationships were recorded, and future analysis will help determine the species origin of the egg shell.  Overall, the analysis of 10th century context [161] from the 2009 excavation season did not add a great deal of evidence of specific bird species being consumed as food; six specimens of bird bone were recovered and none were identifiable to the species level, though one was identifiable to the gull (Larus) family. However the absence of large amounts of bird bones is significant in that it continues to support the apparent pattern of wild eggs, rather than wild birds themselves as food."

First, deposits containing bone and artifacts from all periods were located- in zooarchaeological terms, this is the unique site in Mývatnssveit to yield such a long term record. Especially rich deposits from the early modern period and the settlement period were found during 2009 excavations. Analysis of context [161] in addition to analysis following the 2008 field season has added to our understanding of the variability in the use of domestic mammals and bird resources in this well-studied region. Future directions include a full analysis of the fish bone from Skútustaðir. The long term goals of this project include the integration of this information further into interdisciplinary research agendas aimed at understanding long term human and environmental interactions in Mývatnssveit and the north Atlantic."

In order to reconstruct long-term economics and human ecology at the site, a number of specialist analyses (zooarchaeology, archaeobotany, soil analysis, archaeoentomology) are carried out since then on material recovered during the 2008 and 2009 field seasons. \nReports presenting the general context, goals and investigation strategies for the Skútustaðir research project as well as reports discussing the results of zooarchaeological premilinary analyses are available on the North Atlantic Biocultural Organization (NABO) website: www.nabohome.org.

It was believed that this technique would allow the association of archaeoentomological reconstructions with specific time periods. While it can be difficult to know whether each context excavated from a midden is related to a single “dumping” event, or to connect it to a specific time period, the presence of several tephra horizons in the midden at Skútustaðir provides us with an opportunity to reconstruct changing economics, environments and human dynamics within a good chronological framework.  \nIn order to draw a comparison with modern insects from the surrounding environment, eight pitfall traps and three interception traps were placed in different locations around the site (Table 2 and Fig. 1). The traps were active from June 23rd to July 10th, and were emptied every two days. The location of each trap was recorded using a total station, and the beetles collected in each of them were kept separately. These insects are currently stored in ethanol in the Environmental Archaeology Laboratory of Université Laval, Quebec City, Canada, and have not been identified yet. Therefore, the results of this part of the analysis will not be presented here."

        "Text": "Discussion and Future Recommendations \nConsidering the volume of sediment processed, the samples yielded a paucity of insect fragments. Moreover, the few recovered arthropod remains were poorly preserved and severely disarticulated.  \nBecause of the lacuna of recovered fauna, inferences concerning palaeoeconomical activities and palaeoecological reconstructions were unable to be formulated during this preliminary assessment. \nThe results of this analysis likely reflect a regional and contextual component. Previous examinations of archaeological insect remains from Icelandic sites (cf. Amorosi et al. 1992, 1994; Buckland et al. 1992; Perry et al. 1985) have not typically provided the rich assemblages of their more temperate waterlogged-preserved counterparts (e.g. Hall and Kenward 1976; Kenward and Hall 1995; King et al. 2010). However, the preservation on Icelandic sites has occasionally been excellent, allowing for the recovery of soft-bodied insects such as ectoparasites (Buckland and Perry 1989) and has contributed insight into human activities and living conditions in the region. \nContextually, middens are not generally targeted for the retrieval of archaeoentomological remains (English Heritage 2002). This is likely due to taphonomical factors, such as exposure to the elements, more so than the insects’ habitat specifications. Regardless, insect remains have been recovered in low numbers from contemporary middens in Iceland (King in prep.) and may be found in the Skútustaðir contexts upon further investigation. \nIt is the recommendation of the authors that archaeoentomological analyses continue to be attempted at Skútustaðir. Prior to additional sampling being conducted, the remainder of the material in store at the Université Laval should be analyzed to assist in the development of a sampling strategy. The samples which have been evaluated so far come from deposits accumulated from the 9th to the 14th century. The results might show that the conditions required for the preservation of insect remains do not occur in deposits from an early date at Skútustaðir, but it is still possible that insect remains are preserved in deposits from a later date. The assessment of a selection of samples from areas D and F, which spans the Late Medieval Period and the Modern Period, would thus be recommended. It is also suggested that, where possible, larger bulk samples (5-10 litres) be collected in an effort to enhance the recovery of insect remains from the site. Furthermore, the identification of the trap specimens should be completed as it will provide information regarding the modern entomofauna which may serve as a foundation to assist the archaeoentomological examinations."

        "Text": "Summary \nIn 2007 a joint FSÍ/CUNY NABO team, conducting a coring and test trenching survey, visited Skútustaðir following the discovery of a patch of eroding midden, noted by Árni Einarsson ( of the Mývatn Research Station). Investigations in 2008, lead by Agusta Edwald and Thomas H. McGovern, followed up on the 2007 results with a set of test trenches. The three 2008 test units (D, E1&2, and F) located midden deposits with excellent organic preservation and multiple tephra horizons. Artifacts recovered and tephra observed in area D indicate that the deposits sampled date from ca. 1717-1477, E1 & 2 have an early Viking Age deposit directly upon the Landnám surface, and F revealed a very rich early modern midden deposit and an unexpected structural wall. The 2009 season saw a major expansion of the area D unit into two connected larger units G (13 sq m) and H (20 sq m). Unit G was carried-out down to lava bedrock, revealing an exceptionally productive Viking Age midden deposit packed into the natural fissures and crevices. Large artifact and eco-fact collections were recovered from the early modern and Viking age deposits, with excellent conditions of preservation throughout.  \nObjectives for the 2010 season included further excavation in Area H, where extensive deposits, in some places nearly two meters deep, are known to be present.  In addition a new area was opened a midden near the contemporary house of Gerður Benediktsdóttir.  Excavations of test pits E1 and E2 in 2008 indicated that deposits in the new area could be dated to the Viking age.  In addition to adding to the collection of ecofacts and artifacts, we successfully integrated undergraduate students-in-training into our research process.  Last, structural remains were unexpectedly found in the northern edge of area E3- further indication of the rich archaeological record at Skútustaðir. The structural remains were not excavated or otherwise disturbed as that was not within the scope or permit of the project."

        "Text": "Excavations in Area E3 \nArea E3 formed an “L” shape around the southwestern corner of the modern building.  The area was truncated to the east by two areas excavated in 2008 (E1 and 2) as well as the home itself. The trench edges and corners do not align with the site grid created in 2008. Instead, Óskar Gísli Sveinbjarnarson established absolute points using a trimble and ARGIS software.\nAfter unturfing in area E3, we were able to work back from a clear profile of midden deposits, soil amendment deposits and tephra layers that were previously exposed by the excavation of areas E1 and E2 in 2008. Very intact, flat surfaces of the V1717 tephra and the V1477 tephra were easily encountered beneath relatively homogeneous soil layers containing very scant anthropogenic debris.\nSuch deposits including thinly dispersed domestic waste may likely relate to those described as soil amendments, i.e. varying types of waste added to soil to improve its fertility (Adderly et al 2008). The deposits may be the result of past inhabitants lightly distributing refuse around the home field to fertilize and increase hay production. It is highly significant that the build-up of home field soil at Skútustaðir sharply contrasts the farming landscapes to the south that surround the archaeological farms of Sveigakot and Hrísheimar -which lost soil and productive land to the extent that this may have contributed to their abandonments.\nWhen the V1477 tephra was excavated, the team noted a cracked ground surface. The tephra ran into deep fissures and lines converging in polygon shapes resembling frost polygons. The cracking ran through several stratigraphic units, creating uneven surfaces and was visible in the profiles. In other places, stratigraphy was visibly interrupted by a shift in vertical position of the ground surface. This frost cracking and vertical disturbance was noted in Area E3, though not in Area H."

        "Text": "Excavation down to the 1300 tephra began to reveal a more uneven landscape, with lava bedrock crags appearing in slopes and ridges. Deposits including midden, turf, and gravel were found to have also been spread in E3. It’s possible that residents intentionally spread these materials as general soil amendments or potentially over the tephra.\nAfter the excavation of the deposits below the H1300 tephra, a ridge of lava bedrock emerged which divided the deposits in Area E3. To north side of the bedrock ridge within the trench, deposits lay in a basin created by the bedrock and to the south, deposits lay flat on a more evenly sloped and higher plane of loose bedrock gravel, without the deep bedrock ravines below that we would later find.\nWe encountered southward sloping deposits in the northern side of Area E3 that, when removed, were overlying the remains of the edge of a turf and stone wall. Several stones, approximately 20-30 centimeters in length, were aligned in an east-west direction with turves apparently packed around them. The entire feature lay under the 1262 tephra and the turves contained both the landnám tephra and the V940 tephra placing the wall’s construction at post 940 CE and predating 1262 CE. As more deposits were removed, we found the crevices in the lava surface were deep, and the remains of the wall ran along a ridge of lava bordering a steep drop into the crevice.  "

The density of ash and midden also decreased sharply approaching the depths at which the 1V477 tephra was uncovered.  On the second to last day of excavation, the crew removed the V1477 tephra. In the previous year of excavation, we found there to be few bones or artifacts below the 1477 tephra until we encountered Viking age material. This low density of midden corresponding with what are probably high medieval period contexts is seen both in Area H and Area E3 and was noted in Area G (G was excavated in 2009). People living at Skútustaðir may have shifted their dwelling area during medieval period; at the very least, they certainly changed their area regularly used for habitual refuse disposal.\nExcavation will continue in Area H in the summer of 2011.

Skútustaðir, a long term farming site in the same region, occupies a unique niche within these works as it has so far yielded the most continuous archaeological record of farming, subsistence, diet and economy, when compared to the faunal record from several other sites.  A combination of dense and well-preserved midden deposits and the presence of several volcanic tephra isochrones make this site ideal for extensive study (McGovern in Vésteinsson ed. 2008).  Analysis of the Skútustaðir faunal collection is currently being carried out by the present author at the City University of New York, Hunter College and Brooklyn College NORSEC Zooarchaeological Laboratories. The preliminary results are summarized here. Skútustaðir’s archaeofauna points to a focus on caprines (sheep and goats) but also indicates long- term cattle raising at possibly a higher degree than surrounding farms. Marine fish are present, potentially increasing during the early modern era (1550-1850 CE).  Also present in the archaeofauna are horses, pigs, seals in low numbers and several species of birds. Analysis is ongoing. For detailed reports, please refer to the NABO website: www.nabohome.org"

        "Text": "Introduction \nInvestigations at Skútustaðir emerged out of a regional-scale research design called Landscapes of Settlement that was initiated by Orri Vésteinsson and Adolf Friðriksson. The collective work aimed to describe through archaeology, past regional settlement patterns, economic developments, social histories, and environmental histories of Mývatnssveit. Thus far, the majority of the archaeofaunal collections excavated in the Mývatn area dated to the Viking period and the subsequent medieval period, but none had been recovered from the early modern period. Seeking a broader chronology, Orri Vésteinsson led an Mývatn regional survey which was carried out by CUNY archaeologists. This research was conducted under the project entitled Human and Social Dynamics in Myvatnssveit, Iceland, from the Settlement to the Present, directed by Astrid Ogilvie. Efforts were focused on locating a site with an archaeofauna that included late medieval and post medieval remains (ca. 1300-1900). Following a very promising 2007 coring survey at Skútustaðir (McGovern in Vésteinsson ed. 2008), four test trenches were excavated in 2008: Area E 1& 2, Area D, and Area F. A full report is available as Edwald and McGovern 2008. The 2009 field season included additional trench Areas G and H and the results are described in Edwald 2009 and Hicks 2010."

        "Text": "Field Season 2010: Recovery of Faunal Remains in Area H \nExcavations continued in Area H from the 2009 field season. During the 2009 season, the upper strata of Area H were found to be rich in well-preserved midden remains pertaining to the early modern period (1550-1850 CE).  In 2009, excavation was carried out only through early modern strata so the 2010 field team aimed to excavate Area H as far as possible.  \nIn 2010, Area H was extended down slope to the east by one meter. It measured 4m in width by 8 m and 36 cm in length. We were able to recover bone and artifacts from rich contexts both above and below the V1717 tephra. The chart below details that faunal finds were especially rich in the early modern context [246] and there was good recovery throughout the site phase defined between the V1717 and the V1477 tephras. It should be noted that as a result of significant volumes gravel being recovered along with the faunal remains context [246], the documented number of bags is inflated to some degree. Gravel was recovered along with the bones to maintain time-efficient ant total recovery of sieved material, as context [246] was a mixture of small mammal bone fragments, small fish bones and small (1 cm) gravel.\nExcavations in 2010 ended with the removal of the V1477 tephra on to a deposit that appears to have been truncated by past turf cutting.  We expect that the proposed 2011 field season will allow us to carry excavation in Area H down to the lava bedrock and to reach a particularly important deposit that was present in the contiguous Area G. This deposit was an anthropogenic, bone, rich in-filling of a crevice in the lava bedrock surface that closely related to the V940 tephra (context [161]). The complete excavation of Area H is crucial for the recovery of well-preserved faunal remains from several phases."

        "Text": "Field Season 2010: Recovery of Faunal Remains in Area E3 \nArea E3 was laid out and excavated in 2010 after Viking age and medieval midden remains were uncovered in closely located units (E1 and E2) during the 2008 field season. It measured 9 meters on the western side, 11 meters on the southern side and 4 meters on the northern side. The remaining trench edge was a curving open profile from excavation season 2008, arching around the home of Gerður Benediktsdóttir. In area E3 we hoped to expand our faunal collection from the medieval occupation phase of Skútustaðir. While recovery was excellent from some contexts in E3, others were mostly devoid of the rich archaeological deposits encountered elsewhere within the site. The majority of layers in E3 were composed of silty soils with occasional charcoal and bone and low densities of artifacts. Instead of looking like the characteristic rich middens, commonly preserved in Iceland, these deposits resembled soil amendments, soils enriched by the addition of domestic waste, manure and other materials, as described by Ian Simpson in his work on infield soil characteristics on farms in the north Atlantic (Simpson et al. 2002). Another possibility is that the deposits with thinly dispersed ash and bone could be the edges of thicker midden deposits, thinning as they spread outward from a concentrated area.\nAspects of excavation in Area E3 are reviewed in detail in the main body of the 2011 field report, however, there are some important additional notes regarding recovery of faunal remains. The majority of osseous finds were recovered from contexts between the H1300 and V1410 tephras, while from most other contexts, one bag of bone on average was recovered.  Faunal analysis benefits increasingly with greater sample sizes, so the excavation of Area E3 will certainly benefit our understanding of farming, diet, and economy in the high medieval to the late medieval phase.  It is worth re-iterating here that Area E3 demonstrated and reconfirmed that Skútustaðir’s archaeological sequence is run through with a comparatively high number of tephra, providing very secure and sometimes high- resolution dating.  \nThe depositional patterns of the faunal remains at Skútustaðir clearly changed through time. Based on changing density of midden material, some areas are used intensively for periods and then fall out of use. This likely compliments changes over time in settlement organization, the placement of domestic spaces, work-spaces, animal enclosures, infields, and storage areas.  The decisions regarding where to dispose of disused items relates to and shadows other aspects of use of space, and in this way hints to the variety of processes that make up the archaeological site.   As Skútustaðir is a large site whose remains are segmented by numerous tephras, it seems it would be worthwhile to carry investigation into other realms of past uses, such as those of domestic spaces or sacred and burial places.  As these phenomena are often interrelated in complex ways to the economic activity observable the midden remains."

All elements (bird and mammal) were identified as far as taxonomically possible (a selected element approach was not employed) but most mammal ribs, long bone shaft fragments and vertebral fragments were assigned to “Large Terrestrial Mammal” (cattle or horse sized), “Medium Terrestrial Mammal” (sheep, goat, pig or large dog sized), and “Small Terrestrial Mammal” (small dog-fox sized). Only elements positively identified as Ovis aries and Capra hircus were assigned to the separate sheep and goat categories respectively while all other sheep/goat element were assigned to the “caprine” category potentially including both sheep and goats. Digital records of all data collected were made following the 9th NABONE recording package (a Microsoft Access database supplemented with specialized Microsoft Excel spreadsheets). The animal bones excavated will be permanently curated at the National Museum of Iceland. This report, other reports and data are available from nabo@voicenet.com and the NABO website: www.nabohome.org. \nCuration followed the NABONE protocols followed for other archaeofauna from Iceland, Faroes, Greenland, and northern Norway.

        "Text": "Skútustaðir seems to have a high relative number of cattle (Bos taurus domesticus) compared to other Mývatn region farms studied archaeologically. Where some Mývatn area farms had 22 sheep (Ovis aries) for every cow, Skútustaðir seems to stay well below ten sheep for every cow, throughout its record (Brewington et al 2004, Hicks 2010).   \nThe high ratio of cattle apparently kept at Skútustaðir joins the archaeology with ongoing discussions regarding environmental change, past land use, value, and social change in Iceland. This dialogue is best illustrated in McGovern et al. 2007, Vésteinsson 2008 and Vésteinsson 2000. To summarize some key points, the productivity and value f land in Iceland was linked to its infield hay production capacities and cattle holdings. Cattle depended on hay cultivation to a high degree. Cattle rearing became linked to productive, wealthy elite farms and thus a marker of status.  As Skútustaðir appears to be a long-term elite farm, the ongoing description and study of its economy will lend important new information to studies of the changing socio-environmental conditions of Iceland over a long period of time. This ongoing conversation highlights the crossdisciplinary nature of the study of Iceland’s environmental and social past. It will be worthwhile to apply the archaeofauna from Skútustaðir to carry this discussion through the early modern period as it is a central issue in landscape change in the Mývatn area (McGovern et al 2007, Dugmore et al 2005). Horses (Equus caballus) and pigs (Sus scrofa) are relatively scarce in the faunal collection when compared to caprines and cattle. It has been suggested that horses were not typically eaten in Iceland (especially after ca 1000 CE) because of Christian prohibitions on eating horseflesh. However evidence through space and time in the archaeological record of Iceland suggests that these prohibitions were irregularly heeded."

It was noted both in the field and can be seen in the above chart, that use of fish species appears to increase. More work needs to be done here to securely assert such a pattern and it is currently a preliminary suggestion. Species visible in preliminary observations in the field include members of the cod family (Gadidae) as well as Salmon (Salmo salar), Trout (Salmo trutta) and Char (Salvelinus alpinus). \nScant bird bones demonstrate a low relative frequency of birds being consumed compared to other animals. Bird species found throughout the site include mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), red breasted merganser (Mergus serrator), scaup (Aythya marilla), swans (Cygnus sp.), swan/goose sized specimens, slavonian grebe (Auritus podiceps), longtailed ducks (Clangula hyemalis) and one specimen of gull (Larus sp). Another present avian species was ptarmigan (Lagopus mutus), a local terrestrial bird. One sea eagle claw (Haliatus albicilla) was found in an unstratified context. In addition, domestic chicken (Gallus gallus) was represented among avian fauna.\nMost notably, the team repeatedly unearthed compact, thin, but horizontally dense layers of eggshell in situ during all excavation seasons. A research design is still being formulated to obtain information (such as species identification) from these remains, but they are well documented and sampled. The eggshell most likely belongs to eider ducks (Somateria molissima) that congregate in a small chain of lakes about two hundred meters to the east of the main cluster of modern homes at Skútustaðir. Egg collection has been a long-term practice of Icelanders and there is documentary and archaeological evidence that it has been strictly managed for sustainability over the long term (McGovern et al 2007).                                                                                                                           Seal remains (Phocidae) are present but rare; it is significant to note that the nearest stretch of seacoast is 60 km distant.  Seal bones so far appear to predominantly be distributed amongst early modern contexts. Though it is early in analysis- a preliminary pattern may at least be suggested for further inquiry; that seal remains and marine fish remains (both from the coast) increase into the early modern period (1550-1850 CE).

The material is well sequenced and good amount is of late medieval date which has not received the same attention as the Viking age period and early modern/modern periods in Iceland. The assemblage reflects voluminous and long residence and the material culture will add greatly to our understanding of the function and household of a high-status farm in North Iceland. Through 1000 years of usage the midden might not only provide information on i.e the relevance of imported materials, exploitation of local resources, changes in material culture through time, reuse and recycling and handicraft. It might also add insight to the activity (i.e. household, workshops, smithies) around the midden and (changing) roles of nearby houses suggested by absence/presence of specific waste through time."

The major objective of the 2011 excavation season at Skútustaðir was to complete the excavation of an already begun, large Trench, Area H (measuring 8.36 x 4 meters) by continuing the excavation down to the natural bedrock surface. This was completed by a four person team from CUNY and FSI directed by Adolf Friðrikson, with Francis Feeley, George Hambrecht and Megan T. Hicks (of CUNY, Ph.D. Program in Archaeology).  The archaeological deposits encountered contained animal bone, artifacts and were divided by several datable volcanic tephra layers: the V 1477, V1410, H 1104/1158 and the V940, and the V871 were all identified both in the field and reconfirmed in the lab by Magnus Á. Sigurgeirsson. As in other trenches previously excavated, the late medieval phases directly above and below the V1477 volcanic tephra were nearly entirely void of bone and artifacts. The high medieval phase – above and below the 12th c Hekla volcanic tephra generally rich, culminating in a very dense deposit which lay upon the V940 tephra, context [317]. As always, a program of initiatives outside the excavation enriched the digging season. Garðar Guðmundson (FSÍ) completed a contour survey of the entire farm mound which will contextualize other GIS features. A small survey was carried out, locating potential remains of Skútustaðir´s medieval church and churchyard- this was completed using both late 19th c. photographs and modern photography.  \nAn annual session of educational programming with KAPÍ (Kid´s Archaeological Program, Iceland), included on-site experiences and a mock-excavation for the school age kids in the county. Analysis of artifacts, bones, soils, and archaeobotanical remains is currently underway at the Hunter College Laboratories and Fornleifastofnun Íslands.  "

The Landscapes of Settlement project (NSF OPP 0352596) centered on creating an extensive chronology of settlement for the earliest established farms in Mývatnssveit during the Viking age (871-1000 CE). The NSF funded Human and Social Dynamics of Global Change program led by Dr. Astrid Ogilvie (NSF OPP 0527732) aimed at connecting the archaeological record with the historical record. These research programs culminated in a regional study of human and ecological relationships and settlement history whose publication in American Anthropologist won the Gordon Willey Award for interdisciplinary research (McGovern et al 2007).  \nWhile the work in Mývatn 1996-2006 had produced multiple archaeofauna dating to the Viking age (McGovern et al 2006), including the major collections from Hofstaðir (McGovern et al. in Lucas 2009) only relatively small exposures of medieval middens at Steinbogi (2004) and Selhagi (2001) had taken place. The next step was to attempt to extend the time period of study and connect the settlement age and early medieval period record (871 to 1350 CE) of the Mývatn region to the early modern period and the present."

Soil-coring of middens and selective test pitting was carried out by the team in an effort to localize deeply stratified deposits. Skútustaðir was found to have a remarkable sequence of tephras intersected by substantial midden deposits that appeared to extend over 1.5 meters in depth. The following year (2008) four test trenches were excavated to verify the locations of the densest midden and collect initial data. In 2009, 2010, and 2011, larger areas were excavated in a successful effort to recover substantial artifact and ecofact collections."

        "Text": "The completion of the excavation of midden Trench H was the main goal of the 2011 field season and was therefore a much smaller scale project than in previous years, when at times, multiple large trenches were opened. In 2009, trench H was unturfed as a test trench, but rapidly expanded because of the richness deposits present. In 2009, the V1717 tephra was located among midden, and below were bone and charcoal rich contexts deposited on a sharp slope and extremely friable. To the north side of the trench, immediately below the turf, there was a significant depth historic turf dump overburden which we believe corresponds to the demolition of the 19th c farm house. In next year (2010) the excavation continued to the point of the removal of the V1477 tephra, above which anthropogenic deposits dissipated significantly as excavation continued. Under the V1477 tephra, we encountered deposits of sterile soils. Due to time constraints in 2010, we ended the excavation after removal of the V1477 tephra. This report focuses on the completion of the excavation of trench H in 2011, and notes ongoing work in collaborative analysis. The description of excavations in other areas, and can be found in the reports listed above."

Excavation in 2011 began where that in 2010 it had left off, the deposit directly below the V1477 tephra and context numbering began at [300].  The two deposits following the V1477 tephra were void of anthropogenic material as those directly above the V1477 tephra.   Soon below, we encountered the V1410 tephra, context [302], again encapsulated by deposits mostly devoid of bone and artifacts.  It is notable that these “empty” deposits surrounding the V1477 and V1410 tephra are lacking signs of human activity during a period in which Iceland is known to be impacted by the bubonic plague. Other reasons for their lack of finds and ecofacts may be changes in spatial organization of activities on the farm.\nThe character and pattern of lower midden deposits in Trench H were similar in some ways to the deposits in adjacent Trench G, as they were separated only artificially by excavation years and a 60 centimeter baulk left in place to stabilize backfill deposits."

The largest contexts in H were [315] and [317] and they resembled context [161] in Area G in 2009. All were non-compact midden layers with ample, large mammal bones, fire cracked rock, egg shell and large gravel; charcoal fragments were present and the deposit appeared to be mixed with the V940 tephra, but was later confirmed to be laying just above.  \nIt seems the inhabitants of Skútustaðir were filling natural crevices with midden until about the high middle ages, when the soils and middens filling the surface are level with the crevice edges. This activity could have been a very purposeful or incidental: either inhabitants were seeking out uneven terrain for dumping household garbage, to eventually even or improve it or they were scattering their midden material which would be trodden and roll down into the small ravines and stay there. Whether intentional or not, this long-term pattern of activity made the terrain more even, easier to traverse, and eventually, soil-rich.  "

It was the sheer thickness, friability and mixed nature of [315] that necessitated their being separated, somewhat arbitrarily, in to upper [315] and lower [317] layers. A closer inspection, described in the phasing section of the present work, found the V940 tephra to be just below and in contact with the midden remains in [317]. Further refinement of phasing of these sloping and friable midden deposits might be possible with the help of ongoing artifact analysis. \nA description of similar deposits excavated in 2009, in contiguous Trench G, was published by Edwald 2009: \n“Only 20 cm below the V1477 tephra we began to encounter a deposit rich in large mammal bones and comprised of a looser deposit with small lava stones and lava gravel mixed in with the many animal bones, bird egg shell, fire cracked rocks, and charcoal fragments (Figure 10 below). This deposit resembled other Viking Age middens in Mývatnssveit, and proved to be associated with two 9th-10th c tephra- the V c 940 tephra and the Landnám sequence (V 871). This bone rich deposit rests directly upon the V 871 LNS, which could be traced widely across the unit, but it appears to also be just above or mixed with the later V 940 tephra and is probably mid-10th c in date; perhaps contemporary with the late 9th c fill in Area E1 across the home field.” \nThe uncertainty of the relationship of the 2009 deposit [161]´s relationship to the V940 tephra lead the team to settle on a 10th c. phase for that context.

Sigurgeirsson \nArchaeological research in South, Thingeyjarsysla, Summer 2011 \nTranslation Adolf Friðdrikson, Megan Hicks 1.16.12 \nThe western profile of area H was cleaned and examined. The profile is a composite: the top sixty centimeters are taken from the adjacent south western corner (as they were removed in a previous excavation). There are cultural layers in the entire section down to the upper limit of the Landnám sequence, the LNS. In this profile, there are a number of recognizable tephra layers such as: V 1717, V 1477, H1300, and on the bottom there are the layers of the LNS. A particular attention was paid to the earliest cultural layers with the hope of confirming the earliest date. The LNS layers are quite well-preserved below the cultural deposits. On the top of the LNS there is a grey-green layer about 1-2 centimeters thick. This layer is considerably disturbed, but nevertheless reasonably complete [intact]. The cultural layers lay immediately on top of this one. After a more detailed observation and comparison to more sections elsewhere, it is almost certain that this tephra layer is in fact the so – called V90. Below it there is an extremely thin greenish layer which probably is the Landnám tephra from about 870 [AD]. If this analysis is correct, the earliest deposit layers are from about 940 or shortly after. \nObservations made at coordinate 504/120-121 in the NORTH side of area H. The top 10 cm are grassroots. The tephra V1717 is not visible possibly it has eroded [it is intact in the rest of the profile]. The tephra V1477 is at the depth of 95 centimeters. Some 2.5 centimeters below V1477, there is a dark tephra 0.5 cm thick. And 22 cm further below that layer there is another light colored tephra 1-2 millimeters thick in a light colored soil layer. One can see a continuation of this layer for about 50 centimeters (and it could also be traced in plan according to the excavator). About 10 cm below the light colored tephra there is undisturbed red oxidized slag. It is certain that the layer in question is the Hekla tephra H1104/H1158.  \n…A small test pit - Area F - a short distance from area H was also investigated. Area F was partially excavated in 2008, but some phase issues were unconfirmed. Excavation there ceased because a structure was found and decidedly left unexcavated. The area was consolidated, but firm tephra identification needed attention. We re-opened this area in 2011…\nThere one could observe a thin and coarse tephra layer at a depth of 15 cm. Below that there is a midden deposit at least 70 cm thick (the unit did not go further down [to natural]). The mentioned tephra lies 55 cm above a stone structure which probably belongs to a building. On the basis of the analysis of a sample, it is probably the V1717 tephra. The V1477 tephra is at 67 cm below the coarse tephra. And just above [the 1477 tephra] there is a thin, dark colored tephra. The relative position of these layers resembled very much what one can observe in Area H. It is highly probably that this stone structure is from the 16th or 17th centuries, but it would need to be excavated further in order to have that dating confirmed. (coordinate: N65° 33.953´, V17° 01.980´) Because it contains structural remains, which are not a part of our projected excavation plans for Skútustaðir, area F was consolidated with teram permeable fabric, turf, and soil; it remains as currently the only incomplete excavation area."

Contour lines are superimposed on the image below in black and also shown is the 2011 excavation area in red. It is clear that the significant midden deposits on the Skútustaðir farm mound comprise and are clustered around the highest point of the farm mound- it is truly an anthropogenic feature in the landscape, accumulated atop an undulating lava surface marked with large pseudocraters. Also visible is the artificial flattening undertaken in the area of the rectangular churchyard and to the north of the churchyard."

        "Text": "Small Scale Survey for Medieval Churchyard Remains A walking survey of the farm mound was completed with the hope of finding the precise location of the medieval phase churchyard at Skútustaðir. The general location of the churchyard was known from previous surveys carried out by Hreiðarsdóttir and Vésteinsson (1999).  The 2011 efforts used the information from that report alongside a late 19th century photograph in which the remains of the churchyard are visible. The photograph was printed and carried to the site location; it was aligned with still present geological features to gain the near-precise position of the photographer, and the relative position of his century-old subjects. It is an approximate exercise as similar uses of photographs have been applied in historical archaeology, and many recommend obtaining a camera and lenses that are the same as were used by the original photographer. Our improvised technique was immediately rewarded as a linear stone feature was immediately visible in the area indicated by inference from the original photographs; the ground surface in the area of interest had been eroded by modern use as a gravel-lined driveway, leading to the barn."

        "Text": "A drawing was made of this feature using the southeastern corner of the modern storage barn as a datum point. The drawing (curated at FSI) indicates a point 9 meters site east from this datum. The current area is a driveway, used to access a large storage barn and located to the east of this barn. Further to the east is a modern residence. To the north, there is a clear, rounded, transition to a slope, down toward a smokehouse, a chicken house and further north, the public road.  \nThe linear feature of laid stones is oriented along an east to west axis, providing another hint that it could be remains of the previous church phase; church buildings in Iceland were traditionally aligned E-W. Skútustaðir ’s economic and political position as a church farm and parish administrative center is well-documented. As a church farm, and later a district center, its resources and land rights will have interacted with the particular ways of raising stock and consuming food. Therefore the church influence on daily life has clear implications for the interpretation of the zooarchaeological record. In the late 1800’s a medieval phase church and churchyard were de-sanctified to make way for an early modern church and churchyard at Skútustaðir.  \nThis survey was unplanned, yet informative, it was surmised, in previous surveys that the surrounding area would have been the churchyard (Hreiðarsdóttir and Vésteinnson 1999). The finding of intact remains potentially of the church (later used as a thinghús) suggests that in addition to having excellently preserved middens and numerous tephra, Skútustaðir might be able to contribute to archaeological studies of local administrative assembly houses, churches or burial grounds."

Most of these tephra have been located in strata in the two major excavation areas (H and E). A suite of AMS C14 dates on fully terrestrial cattle and caprine bones supports and refines this tephrabased chronology, with datable artifacts thus far providing close correlation. The archaeological record is rich and accurately datable, making Skútustaðir a unique and important archaeological resource. "

        "Text": "While the specific pattern and timing of initial settlement in the Mývatn region, in the 9th c. is the subject of ongoing study, it is clear that the first residents of Skútustaðir were able to secure a highly strategic physical location in the region that allowed them access to riverine resources, lake resources, ample hay meadows and perhaps control over the southern passable, lakeside terrain in Mývatn. A find of a gold foil-lined, Byzantine bead in Viking age deposits may attest to the early residents’ high status, or at least access to prime luxury items. Coupled with a Viking-age radiocarbon date, indicates an early presence.\nThe faunal record from the Viking age so far indicates that the residents were making use of terrestrial mammals for much of their food, managing sheep for wool and meat, cows for dairy and meat, horse and pig bones are rarely found –horses were likely mostly for transport. Thick and extensive layers of bird egg shell and the occasional trout or char bone indicate early exploitation of wild resources in the farm’s immediate territory.  As in other inland Viking Age sites, there are abundant remains of headless marine fish (mainly haddock and cod) imported from the coast 60-70 km away. Viking age deposits at Skútustaðir have proven exceptionally rich and extensive generating a count of 95 standard bone sample bags (from contexts between the 871 – 1104/58 tephras) of a total collection of 647 bags. This provides excellent comparative material for the other known Viking Age archaeofauna from the region and the wider North Atlantic, and analysis of this phase will provide a major contribution for cross regional comparative study. Analysis of the animal bone from Skútustaðir’s middens is currently underway at the Hunter College NORSEC Laboratories and the results presented here are preliminary and expected to change slightly as more data is added."

        "Text": "The early modern period (1550-1910 CE), corresponding roughly to after the fall of the V1477 tephra) is also well represented in the deposits excavated thus far, with 311 standard bone sample bags recovered from deposits that also generated a large number of datable finds, particularly post-1600. In 2009, 2010 and 2011, excavations allowed the recovery of an excellent assemblage of faunal remains and artifacts from the early modern period (1550-1900).  \nThe analysis of this ample early modern (1550-1900) evidence from Skútustaðir demonstrates a continued focus on sheep rearing for wool, meat, and dairy, as told by the variety of ages at which sheep are killed off. Extensive tooth eruption and wear studies clearly demonstrates some sheep being killed off at a very young age as part of a culling and dairying regime, large bodied, almost mature sheep are killed off as ideal meat, as well as very mature individuals likely kept in to old age for their wool (Hicks 2010). Where cows are found in the archaeofauna they are very often neonatal, suggesting constant dairying activity. Both horses and pigs are low in numbers in the midden, not being the main choice as food items consistently in this and other Icelandic archaeofauna. \nSignificantly more marine resources are present during the later phases than in earlier phases and there are indications of changing foodways. Preliminary counts suggest that the amount of Cod family (gadidae) fish steeply rises, including both cranial and post-cranial elements for the first time. Finds of ice-riding harp seal bones in the 16th -17th c deposits at Skútustaðir may reflect both these coastal impacts and their effects deep inland, and the many pottery and kaolin tobacco-pipe finds from the 17th -19th c layers clearly reflect world-system connections and impacts. It is as yet unclear whether the early modern residents of Skútustaðir were among the less vulnerable elite during this time or whether they were as many other Icelanders “coping with hard times” (Edvardsson et al. 2004). However, literature and primary sources from the early modern period points to many large farms being of mixed status.  "

        "Text": "While the Viking age and high medieval assemblages at Skútustaðir will provide excellent comparative collections for Mývatn region work, the early modern archeological layers at Skútustaðir will contribute new information from lake Mývatn to the growing archaeology of early modern Iceland (Lucas & Snaesdottir 2006, Edwald & Hicks in press, Hambrecht 2008, 2010) and to the wider application of environmental perspectives to the human ecodynamics of the past 500 years.   \nSheep and their grazing has been a central concern of the rich zooarchaeological and landscape studies produced by interdisciplinary research teams in Mývatn in the last decade. A significant increase in sheep relative to other animals is archaeologically visible at around 1300 CE (Brewington et al 2004  McGovern et al 2007). Furthermore, the 1710 Jarðabok documented about 1 to 25 cattle to sheep in the 18th c.  A productive session of archival research focusing on early modern period livestock management was begun in the summer of 2012 with support of the Comparative Islands Ecodynamics Grant (PI Thomas H McGovern, CUNY, National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programs Grant 1202692) and with the welcoming help of Sif Jóhannesdóttir at Husavik Museum and Culture house and Águsta Edwald (University of Aberdeen).  By collecting the precise livestock counts provided by 19th c. Hay Reports (Hey Ásetning Skyrsla), this archival research hopes to provide a detailed understanding of early modern herd management strategies and landscape use in Southern Mývatn, adding to the timeline understood by years of interdisciplinary work (McGovern et al 2007). The outcomes of analysis of those documents as so far yielded the following critical understandings of late 19th and early 20th century sheep farming and landscape use at Skútustaðir and surrounding farms: outfield hay sources are the major factors in making two farms, Graenavatn and Skútustaðir, the richest in hay in the district in the late 19c. The ratio of sheep to cows approached 75:1 on the Southern Mývatn Districts in the late 19 c. There was in increase in the opportunity for farmers to export sheep and sheep products thanks to the Husavik Trade Association after 1882, but earlier, similar forms of trade seem to persist just before.\nSkútustaðir’s zooarchaeological record is clearly impacted by large scale economic interaction, like export markets, over the long term while other sets of evidence highlight localized practices."

Generously funded by the NSF Office of Polar Programs (Centennial Scale Human Ecodynamics in Skútustaðir N. Iceland Awarded 2012 PIs McGovern and Hicks). Skútustaðir’s archaeofaunal collection uniquely provides this long term archaeological record for this work. Beyond terrestrial farming and regular fishing, modern residents of Mývatnssveit annually collect 10,000 or more eggs from nests of a wide range of waterfowl migrating from both Europe and North America to breed and nest in what is now a UNESCO recognized world natural heritage area. Adult birds are not hunted, and a specific number of eggs are left in each nest to ensure successful reproduction and a sustainable harvest. Records extending back to the mid-19th century document a remarkable local level management strategy that continues to the present. Extensive layers of archaeological eggshell has been found in most Mývatn area excavations, dating from first settlement in the late 9th c. through the 20th century. A pilot study is now underway to identify this eggshell following the methods laid out by Jane Sidell (British Museum of Natural History). Using SEM technology McGovern et al previously demonstrated that most of the eggs recovered archaeologically were from waterfowl, but others were from the resident ptarmigan (grouse) and a few derived from sea birds (2006). Skútustaðir’s temporally extensive archaeological record makes possible the study of this practice from the settlement age through to the present. This millennium-long sustainable use of this fragile natural resource is now subject of a documentary film and will be subject to coordinated ethnographic, historical, and biological investigation with the active cooperation of local residents during the next few years (see Edwald 2012).

        "Text": "It is clear that Skutustaðir´s rich and long term archaeological record can help us reveal significant economic shifts and important local practices.  It is key to continue midden excavations there for at least one more year to ensure large sample sizes from each temporal phase. Excavation in subsequent years should focus on rounding out the sample of bones from all phases. While the current Skútustaðir archaeofauna does contain well-dated material from the medieval period (48 bags), the period, which we may delineate by tephras from ca. 1150-1410 represents the smallest portion of the current collection (many contexts did not fill one sample bag to capacity). Apparently patterns of deposition on the farm midden shifted from Viking age to medieval periods, with very little medieval material ending up in the large area H unit compared to the rich Viking and early modern deposits. There is excellently preserved medieval material in the area E excavation unit, with sheet midden extant between the 1262-1300 and 1410-1477 tephras providing particularly good finds of bone and artifacts, but these layers are thinner than the deep deposits in the H unit. This medieval material from unit E is very useful, but given the importance of the period for our knowledge of settlement pattern and ecodynamics there is an urgent need to expand the excavation of these sheet middens to recover sample sizes more directly comparable to the Viking age and early modern collections."

        "Text": "Progress made in the 2011 excavation season will expand our knowledge, and the size of our data sets for the early medieval period in the Mývatn region. By far the most bone was recovered from the settlement age/medieval context [317].  This information is extremely valuable as it will provide excellent comparative material for other early farm settlements in the Mývatn area including Hrísheimar, Sveigakót, and Hofstaðir. As described in the previous excavation narrative contexts [315] and [317] in filled the uneven lava surface which was the ground surface exposed in the Viking age through medieval period of settlement. This distinct surface is noteworthy because it so contrasts the modern surface and function which is a rich hay infield. Not only bone was recovered from these rich contexts but charcoal and eggshell samples were taken for further specialist study at CUNY, in collaboration with Háskoli Íslands and at Durham University. Finally the archaeofaunal data and analysis will be continued as the Ph.D. thesis work of CUNY archaeology graduate, Megan T. Hicks."

        "Text": "A Preliminary Summary of Artifacts \nWith tephrochronology evidence, the contexts excavated in 2011, in Are a H can be placed into the following phases:  \n? Late Middle Ages 1410 - 1477 - CE\n? High to Late Middle Ages 12th c. - 1410CE\n? Settlement- Commonwealth 940 -12thC CE \nVery few pottery fragments were present, though, iron, cupreous (Cu) alloys, bone and stone objects were common.  Iron objects included nails, roves and unidentifiable fragments. Cu alloy objects recovered included a wire, fragments in sheet form as well as a particularly well crafted, small buckle. Bone/antler objects were combs, pins and fragments of unknown objects \nMany stone artifacts were recovered including non-native schist whetstones, whetstone fragments, a spindle whorl likely carved from a local tuff (Beck pers. comm.), struck stone flakes (of indeterminate origin), and colorful, naturally polished non- local pebble manuports that may have been used in any manner. These manuports were kept as they may be identified to an origin outside of Iceland or may provide some information on Icelandic interregional exchange geography. \nOne bead was found and the material may be of a greenish stone or glass, its identification is pending further analysis. \nSeveral bone artifacts were recovered including bone pins and combs that could be bone, antler and or mixed material. A number of comb fragments still had copper or iron rivets present and one was ornately decorated with unusual inset copper “windows” as well as carved designs.   \nThe objects and materials found don’t contrast tephra identifications. However it is hoped that careful analysis of the artifacts in [315] and [317] by Guðrun Alda Gíslasdottir will help refine the latest dates of those contexts.  \nNo industrial white wares, pipe stems, or machine-made nails were found in 2011 which might indicate post-depositional disturbance, severe contamination or vastly misinterpreted chronologies.   \nFour small contexts close to the bedrock, were not able to be particularly well phased- they were found below the V1477 tephra and above bedrock- lacking earlier tephras. However, these contained no artifacts and very little bone. Those contexts [312], [316] [318], [319], will not be included in the below phased tallies discussion of artifacts by material.  \nIn all of the excavation areas in Skútustaðir, there has generally been a scarcity of bones and finds in the soil deposits approximately around the V1477 tephra. These include those below the 16th c tephra (where present such as in area H) and above the V1410 tephra. Where there have clearly been ample bones and finds in other phases pertaining to the early modern period, the early Middle Ages and the Viking Age. \nThis overall pattern can be seen in the record of artifact abundance in the above mentioned phases. The contexts [300], [301], [302], [303], [304] and [305] contained little bone or artifacts. Following the general pattern, the V1477-1410 phase, a general lack of archaeological finds there including both artifacts and ecofacts."

It is also providing new information on the less understood early modern period. For this reason it will be essential to round out the medieval period assemblage by continuing midden excavations.  To accomplish this, at least one more midden excavation season is proposed, focusing on Area E, near the modern house -an area where much medieval midden was uncovered in 2010.  \nOf further interest for future excavation years are Skútustaðir´s known intact structural remains, between the V1477 and V1717 tephras in Area F and the medieval phase churchyard. Future excavation of these features may improve our knowledge of landscape organization and settlement organization in the high medieval and late medieval periods.  Ongoing, intensively collaborative projects in archaeology, ethnography and paleoecology, centered around excavations at Skútustaðir, are continually producing reports and publications available on nabohome.org.

The region has been a focal point of archaeological and paleoenvironmental projects for over two decades including the Landscapes of Settlement Project and Human and Social Dynamics in Mývatnssveit. Such work has been interdisciplinary and collaborative from field research through analysis and publication (McGovern et al. 2007). The majority of research in the region has focused on settlement history, paleoecology and paleoeconomy of the first settlement through 1300. In 2007, additional NSF International Polar Year funding enabled North Atlantic Biocultural Organization (NABO) teams to survey the Mývatn area for a settlement with a long-term chronology (McGovern 2007, Vésteinsson 2008).  One of many farms tested during the 2007 survey was Skútustaðir; named as an early farm in Reykdæla Saga (ÍF X). Coring results showed that the midden layers were well preserved, nearly two meters deep in some areas and separated by several identifiable dateable volcanic tephra layers providing excellent chronological relationships.  Excavations of Skútustaðir began with a year of test trenching in 2008 and crews moved on to open large excavation areas in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2013. The project has unearthed wellpreserved continuous evidence of the farm’s economy between the Viking age, the middle ages, the period of modernization; in total, AD 871 through approximately AD 1910.

        "Text": "The purpose of the 2013 excavation was to recover additional animal bone, artifacts and botanical samples - from the Middle Ages, roughly AD 1000-1500. To accomplish this, an excavation area E4, a 5 x 5 m trench, was opened adjacent to a previous area E3, investigated in 2010. It was hoped that the new area E4 would contain a continuation of the same deposits of previously found material dating to the Middle Ages. Midden material including animal bone, hearth sweepings, discarded household objects, and discarded turf from this phase were indeed identified and samples recovered. Density of anthropogenic debris increased below the V1477 tephra. In addition, collapsed turf and stone structural remains were encountered and were left unexcavated - their disuse was provisionally, albeit broadly, dated to before the fall of the 1410 Veiðivötn volcanic tephra.  An additional test excavation area was opened, Area I, which was a 2 x 3 meter test trench slightly to the south of the hillcrest and of interest because of the dense Early Modern material present. Both excavation areas were exclusively targeting midden material including samples of bone, archaeobotanical remains and artifacts and successfully recovered samples from every phase. The confirmation of the presence of a structure at least as old as the Middle Ages provides a potential subject for future field investigations."

The archaeological evidence of this long term settlement offers a chance to understand the economies against a backdrop of associated ecological conditions well studied in Mývatn, and alongside excellent comparative zooarchaeological data, while extending such work toward the early modern period which is lesser-known in the region. Two in press publications completed this year document areas of ongoing intensive investigation and analysis. The first investigates the sustainable long term egg collection and management of wild birds in Mývatn (Hicks et al. 2014 in review). This work is being carried out with collaborators from The University of Aberdeen, The University of Iceland and the Mývatn Research Station. The archaeofaunal data is further being mobilized toward understanding the impacts of modernizing trade on livestock management at the farm and in its lakeside district.  This work uses zooarchaeology and written records to document changes in the management  of livestock and related resources as well as to relate the above to sociopolitical situations, community governance and agency, changing long distance markets, and political/economic transformation (Hicks 2014 in press).  \nThe excavations at Skútustaðir have run side by side with a long-term community collaboration including partners from NABO and the Thingeyingar Archaeological Society (in Icelandic, Hið þingeyska fornleifafélag) and The Kid’s Archaeology Project, Iceland (KAPI: in Icelandic, Fornleifaskóli barnanna). Outdoor and indoor projects, crafted each year by archaeologists, educators and community leaders focus on sharing archaeological thinking, discovery, methods, and techniques while emphasizing ecological interconnections and landscape. In 2013, the partnership created three days of programming with elementary and middle school aged students on-site as well as a very successful mock excavation and a well-attended archaeology open house and celebration.  \nThe present report is a preliminary field report with sections describing the excavation, zooarchaeology, and artifact analysis. Discussion of educational and outreach activities was provided by local specialists Unnstein Ingasson, Baldur Danielsson and Pétur Ingólfsson. Excavation reports pertaining to other project years as well as zooarchaeological reports can be found online at nabohome.org and instarch.is.

Hicks \nIn 2010, an excavation area E3 was opened adjacent to the modern home of Gerður Benediktsdóttir and this area near the highest point of the home field contained well-stratified midden layers below the Veiðivötn AD 1477 volcanic tephra (Hicks et al. 2011) In 2013 area E4 was opened exactly 50 cm west of Area E3 to add to our sample size of faunal remains and artifacts for study from the Middle Ages and in doing so we confirmed the presence of part of a substantial structure, which was left unexcavated. Excavation was carried out according to the FSI excavation guidelines including single context recording and 100% sieving through 4mm mesh.  "

        "Text": "To summarize the findings in area E4, deposits descending from the topsoil to the V1477 tephra are categorized as infield soils (Adderly et al. 2008) with sparse midden remains including bone, ash and early modern/modern artifacts. Below the V1477 and V1410 tephras, the density of midden remains increased and deposits were identified as intentional dumps of midden mixed with turf. The structural remains identified consist of row of stones oriented in a general N/S direction uncovered in the western side of the trench. Below the H1104/1158 tephra, the volume of deposits layed in a natural, linear depression in the lava bedrock and are composed of midden, turf dumps, and collapsed or discarded stone, perhaps structural. It seems that after the middle ages the structure fell out of use, the area was refuse disposal and in early modern times – an enriched hay infield. Without indulging too much in literal interpretations of the sagas, this early structure straddling a ravine in the bedrock is evocative of the descriptions of the Viking age dwelling of “Killer Skúta” in the Saga of the People of Reykjadalur, that describes his domestic space overlying “a subterranean passage”(Reykdæla saga, ÍF X, chap. 28). \nArea I, a small trench, was also opened just south of the crest of the hill – the aim was to test deposits here as they have only been documented through coring.  The very dense midden deposits of modern and early modern remains in area I were pitted by subsequent modern postholes and cuts of an unknown purpose. The anthropogenic content of deposits generally decreased in density as the excavation progressed toward the older layers some mirrored trench E3 in composition. Area I has excellent potential should future project goals call for more data gathering pertaining to the early modern phase of the site."

Kaolin clay tobacco pipes are known to arrive in Iceland through import in the early 17 century and they fall out of use perhaps in the late 19th century, therefore their presence in this deposit agrees with the preliminary chronological interpretation.   \nDeposit [403] was red brown silt with gravel, traces of charcoal and midden.  Within it was an unknown, thin dark grey tephra, which was not evenly present and was removed with the deposit. This could be the same tephra found in the 2011 excavation (Hicks 2013, p 22) which has been identified elsewhere on site. Artifacts found included glass, earthenware pottery fragments, kaolin pipe stem fragment <36>, obsidian, earthenwares <110>, iron fragments, and Cu alloy objects.   \nThe deposits noted thus far have had broad horizontal extents and seem to be infield soils where hay may have been cultivated.

The deposit was approximately 2 cm thick and a notable green tint.  An iron nail and copper alloy object were found within. Deposits better- described as midden dumps and turf dumps, and were more common below the V1477 tephra, signaling a change in activity in this area across this horizon.  \nA silty midden deposit [411] separated the above from the probable V1410 tephra [418]. This midden context yielded one bag of bone, as well as a Cu alloy object, manuport stone, earthenware, worked bone, and an unidentified iron object. \nIn other excavation areas on this farm mound, the grey V1410 tephra [418] has similarly been found just a few centimeters below the V1477 tephra with moderately anthropogentic or fairly empty deposits in between the two chronologically close tephras.\nThese deposits are of interest as they can potentially provide evidence of Iceland’s experience of the black plague eposides in 1402-3 and the late 15th c. Below the V1477 tephra and subsequent context [411], a linear arrangement of stones was partially exposed, oriented in  a north/south direction, on the western and uphill side of the excavation unit. These formed part of an unknown ruin, of which the outline and central depression are barely visible contours in the modern day homefield grasses. Below the V1410 tephra, more collapsed structural stone was uncovered and left in situ.  Midden remains increased in density; ash, bone and artifacts were more common and a series of deposits of mixed turf and midden dumps were interdigitated with gravel deposits associated with wall collapse [434]. After the loose gravel was removed, a 1 meter protective baulk (unexcavated area) was delinieated along the entire western side of the trench to protect the structural remains and preserve them for future excavations."

Midden deposit [424] contained ample large bone fragments. Dumped blocks of turf composed the bulk volume of the context and within the cut and disposed turf blocks was a stratigraphy of what appeared to be the H1300 tephra (warm grey and coarse grained), the white H1104/1158 tephra and the multicolored 940/871- dating the turfs to post 1300. One iron object was recovered from [424]. Deposit [427] was gravel and sandy silt, removed to view wall stones down to a planned surface that was left intact [438].\nContext [429] was a fairly uniform silty midden deposit with charcoal fragments and the grey tint of wood ash.

        "Text": "Below [442] on the southern side of the trench, deposits [445] were composed of significantly more gravel. The nature of the bedrock on this site is that it undulates with both steep and irregular changes in topography. This gravel was atop high region among uneven bedrock. The deposits immediately above the bedrock in other excavation units at this site have been a similar mix of soil and the extremely friable gravel the latter originating as part of the natural lava surface below. We decided to clean the high bedrock surface, with the mixed [445] thoroughly before addressing the deposits in the steep depression. [455] is thus phased as 1410-landnam and was likely formed when the first inhabitants of the farm discarded refuse and walked on a near-barren lava gravel surface with little or no soil. An iron object and fire-cracked rock were recovered from this context and a small amount of bone.  \nAlthough the removal of [455] meant going slightly out of phase, doing so allowed us to maintain a clearer picture of verifiably natural surfaces, with secure relationships, out of the fissure before proceeding to the deep deposits within in the bedrock fissure. Clearing [455] to the natural surface also allowed the crew move and out of the excavation area withouth disturbing or contaminating the friable deposit. \nBelow [445], bedrock with light brown natural soil patches with very intact V940 and/or V871 tephra [456]\nContext [448] is a light brown turf dump with occasional bone, an unknown iron object and a bone comb fragment <167>.  It is the first context confined to this crevice in the bedrock. A few points are worth noting here that midden remains are put to use for a practical purpose people can place midden in the landscape to amend and improve soils, hide or obscure refuse, accumulate or diffuse refuse, or in this case apply it to change topography. These midden remains in the small ravines at Skútustaðir seem to have been  rapidly accumulated (McGovern and Edwald 2009, Hicks et al. 2012), filling ravines early in the course of settlement – suggesting purposeful topographic alterations were made by the first settlers of this farm.  \nDirectly below [448] was a white tephra, which is very likely the Hekla 1104/1158. Identification of this tephra is quite reliable when taking in to account its position below a bone/antler comb fragment and that it is above the landnam sequence. Areas of this in situ tephra were more visible than others, but traces of it were encountered clearly in the west end of the area with faint traces to the east.\nBelow this tephra, deposit [452] was a midden and turf dump composed of brown silty soil with midden, charcoal and turf. Below, context [453] was silty soil, possibly degraded turf, densely laminated with very greenish grey tephra. Initially it was thought to be tephra in situ, but was later found not to extend beyond the turfy matrix. Beyond being isolated to the bedrock crevice, there were no significant indications that this turf was part of intact structural remains; it was below and above midden layers.                                                                                                                                In the northern end of the trench, the bedrock rose to the same level as in the southern end, meaning we were finding the deposits within a trough oriented roughly site east/west. The bedock was similarly a highly friable surface as [455] and this context [454]. We cleaned this surface down to sterile bedrock. Traces of the H1104/1158 tephra were above this thus it is phased as landnam through H1104/1158.  "

        "Text": "Deposits in sequence [455], [458], [459], [460], [461], [462], were all within the bedrock ravine and are alternating layers of midden and turf dumps. Some inclusions were medium sized stone approximately 10-20 cm. Turf, stone and gravel dumps with occasional midden, could be evidence of efforts to fill this uneven surface possibly around a structure in use. The agglomerations of turf and stone did not look distinctly structural though detailed spatial plans were made.  Fire cracked rock and iron fragments were found in deposit [455] while deposit [461] included an iron rove <182> and an unidentified iron object.  \nBelow the turf dumps, deposit [463] was notably waterlogged and finely banded. The banding alternated between a mid-light brown clayish silt soil and green-grey sandy silt -likely to be re-deposited tephra. The marked water logging of this context and its location at the bottom of a deep lava crevice, adjacent to the structural remains considered with its lenses of clayish texture and traces of coprolytes suggests that it could be a byre drain or a latrine. However the volume of the deposit seemed to be turf. The sandy lenses were thick and grayish green, possibly tephras, and as the layer pre-dates the 1104/1158 ash fall, the tephra lenses are hypothesized to be V871 and/or V940-within turf. The context was very deep. In fact, it was not completely excavated but was extensively sampled (10 x 10 L buckets and 3 x large plastic sample bags). Only a small quantity of bone was recovered from [463] - though the damp conditions of the deposit could be ideal for entymological sample recovery.  \nOur in-the-field description of [463] was preliminarily expanded by Árni Einarsson (next section) at the Mývatn Science Station where the samples are currently stored at cold temperatures and tightly sealed. The deposits below [463] in the bedrock depression were quite deep and due to time constraints, were not completely excavated down to the natural surface below. However, as they may relate to the use of the building to the west, their being left intact allows the future study this relationship both in the standing profile and through continued excavation of the structure to the west."

        "Text": "The excavation area was closed after protective, water-permeable fabric was placed in the trench atop the intact wall remains and the remainder of deposit [463] in the bedrock ravine. It was backfilled entirely with soil from the sieve spoil heap and high quality turves were placed down and watered.  \nThe major findings from this excavation area E4 convey a fluctuating use of space over 1000 years of settlement of Skútustadir. The deposits above the V1477 tephra strongly suggest the area being used as an enriched infield with occasional discarded household refuse from AD 1477 through the present. Below and before the fall of the 1477 tephra,  the nearby structure fell out of use and midden dumped on the adjacent ground surface.  The midden deposits below/before the V1410 tephra could date to a time when the building was in use, while turf dumps, stone, gravel and midden in the lava ravine below the H1104/1158 tephra may have had the purpose of leveling the highly uneven ground surface potentially near the contemporary structure. Context [463] (the possible byre drain) should be analyzed further as it may lend additional insight in to the use of the building. Overall, artifact recovery and preliminary artifact chronologies support the hypothesized tephra identifications. Recovery of animal bone samples for analysis will fill in data sets between AD 1000- 1500, while the early structure at Skútustaðir presents excellent target for future work. "

        "Text": "The sample was a knife-point sample from a light band from SKU 13, area E4, context [463], on 29 July 2013. Under the microscope at 400x magnification it appeared as a predominantly very fine-grained whitish minerogenic material with coarse tephra grains in between. Diatom fragments (Epithemia, Rhoicosphenia, Synedra, Gomphonema, \"Fragilaria\"), coprophilous fungal spores (possible Podospora type), phytoliths and pollen were common. Plant fibers and other organic material seemed almost absent.  \nInterpretation: The diatoms observed are species commonly found growing on vegetation in open fresh water, e.g. along pond edges, but less likely in bog surfaces.  One might expect to see those diatoms in hay from such places or in manure from animals grazing along pond edges or fed hay from there. Lake Mývatn is not a likely place of origin: although the diatom species are all found in Lake Mývatn one would expect a completely different species composition (with Fragilariaceae dominating) if the material was from there.  A preliminary judgment is that the material contains residue of hay from a wet meadow or manure from livestock fed such hay, or both. Future analyses of insect remains and phytoliths might be used for testing this hypothesis."

        "Text": "Excavation Narrative: Area I\nCameron Turley, Ágústa Edwald, and Sant Mukh Khalsa\nExcavation of Area I, a small, exploratory 2 by 3 meter trench southwest of Area E4, began on July 10, 2013. The primary goal for the area was exploration of the hilltop at the site, which has gone unexplored in previous seasons. A naturally eroding area on the southern side of the hill exposes present early modern artifacts while adjacent excavation area E4 has revealed pre AD 1410 structural remains. These nearby deposits hint at this area being archaeology rich. A test trench in this area might be revealing of numerous past activities, midden formation and outdoor activity areas near the hilltop structure identified by the concurrent excavation of E4 in 2013. \nArea I ultimately contained cultural deposits covering time periods from recent modern to circa C.E. 940. The most common use of this small hilltop section was as a dumping area for midden materials. The Veiðivötn 1717 tephra fall provides a terminus post quem for six discrete phases of trash deposition—this count considers material from the topsoil as a separate event. Modern and early modern materials are ubiquitous in late contexts, consisting of a fairly standard mix of trash materials. White glazed and painted earthenwares, extruded wire nails, bottle glass technology from hand-blown to moldmade, are all represented to varying degrees in the upper strata. Faunal remains were ubiquitous, as expected with the middens at Skútustadir, though contexts [405, 408, 409] were particularly rich. Most of the late midden dumps were deposited on a relatively level or slightly sloping surface, but fill [412] was placed into a cut [413] that extended below the 1477 tephra in the southeast corner of Area I. Whether or not the cut was initially intended to serve as dump is unknown. Several modern posts and a posthole within the fill are suggestive of a boundary corner, but definite identification to such a function is not possible in such as small test area."

These deposits exhibited a relatively high density of faunal material, particularly [432], but diverge in character from later and earlier Area I midden contexts in that they contain much more evidence of burned material. These strata show the highest proportions of charcoal, peat ash, and wood ash encountered in the trench. Other artifacts were infrequently deposited in this area at this time. One copper object, one iron fish hook, a river stone, and an iron key were the only artifacts recovered.\nAn earlier phase of events in Area I is secured between the hypothesized H1300 and V940 tephras. Once again, this phase is primarily characterized by successive midden deposition and turf dumping activities. Bone density remains relatively high. The major departure when compared to later phases is the matrix of each deposit. Units [440] and [444] are extremely dense with gravel inclusions that range from pea-sized to one to two cm, far more than later midden deposits. They are also much thicker than most of the other deposits, particularly those phased between V1717 and H1300.

        "Text": "Context [447] is somewhat perplexing. It is an extremely dense, compact, and level gravel fill. When initially exposed, the stratum was suggestive of a natural deposition, but exploratory soundings revealed bone at the bottom of the context. It is worth noting that all of the bone recovered from [447] was at the bottom of the layer, at the interface with the bedrock and the two earliest deposits, [449] and [450]. The compaction and level bedding angle are suggestive of an occupation surface. While this might not represent an occupation surface or floor, it does have the appearance of deliberate preparation. Alternatively, the leveling and compaction might be the result of frequent foot traffic by either people or livestock. \nThe earliest anthropogenic layer, [450], was defined in a bedrock depression below [447]. The 940 tephra was contained within the small, bone dense context, though it did not appear to be in situ as the matrix above and below the small patch was consistent in terms of both composition and inclusions. \nContext [449] is a natural deposition isolated to the southeast corner of the excavation unit. Its composition is very well sorted silt with two in situ tephra falls, most likely 871 and 940. Both were sampled to confirm their origins. This natural deposit covered degraded purple and red bedrock materials. The combination of natural silt containing very early in situ tephras and bedrock signaled the complete removal of anthropogenic material from Area I."

Evidence of alternative uses for this space, including fence post cuts, added more detail to the history of uses of this hill top location. The excavation area I was intentionally placed approximately 3 meters to the south of the hypothesized structure, contributing to the possibility of finding traces of diverse and complex activities nearby. In the end, midden remains were predominant while context [447] was the only deposit suggestive of a possibly leveled surface."

        "Text": "Context Descriptions\nUnit [Topsoil]\nUnit [404] This late anthropogenic deposit covered the entirety of the trench and was registered as unit number [404]. The sediment matrix was a firm, dark gray silt heavily clasted with gravel inclusions, which accounted for up to 40 percent to the stratum’s total volume. Excavators also noted mottling, apparently the result of turf dump or collapse. Artifactual material recovered is generally recent, though some materials, like a handblown glass bottle <006>, could be older. A variety of ceramics are also counted among the diagnostic artifacts. Overall, the deposit is characteristic garbage dumping activities.\nUnit [405] was underlain by a roughly similar turf dump or collapse, which was registered as [405]. Again, the context covered the entirety of Area I. The matrix was moderately compact silt with pockets of coarse sand, mottled red, brown, and yellow. Occasional patches of charcoal were noted throughout the context. Thickness of the deposit was variable, ranging from 10 to 15 cm. Artifacts present are relatively recent, ranging from an abundance of extruded wire nails to mold-made glass bottles and white earthenware. Wood posts were found in the southeast corner of the trench, perhaps marking the edge of an old fence line. \nUnit [407] was a small, lensed deposit of coarse red and black sand in the eastern half of Area I, apparently dumped onto [408]. It did not extend to any edge of the trench. Two small shards of brown bottle glass were the only anthropogenic materials recovered from the context. Unit [408] Context [408] was a mixed turf debris and general trash dump in the western portion of the trench. The matrix was mottled brown, reddish brown, and yellow silt, interspersed with occasional sandy lenses, charcoal flecks, peat-ash, and blocks of turf. Thickness was greatest in the west end of the trench, the deposit lensing out to the east. A portion of [408] was truncated by cut [413] in the southeast corner. Bone, eggshell, ceramic, glass, wire, and wire nails were again common in this deposit. \nUnit [409] - was interpreted as a midden deposit restricted to the west side of Area I, where it underlies [408]. Similar to the previous deposit, this context lensed out to the east. The matrix was a friable black and gray silt interspersed with wood ash, peat ash, and charcoal. Bone was common throughout and consisted of an increased proportion of fishbone. Artifacts represented in the context were still relatively modern, including square extruded nails, ceramics, and what might be fragments of degraded rubber material. Six grams of wood were sampled and registered as sample #31. \nUnit [410] This context was described as a deposit of mixed turf debris that covered most of Area I, with the exception of where it was cut by [413] in the southeast corner. Exposure of [410] allowed for the definition of the full horizontal extent of cut [413]. The matrix was primarily friable mid-brown silt that darkened toward the eastern extent of the trench, possibly the result of charcoal staining. Artifacts recovered remain fairly recent, as evidenced by an extruded wire nail and white earthenware. Interestingly, a small knapped piece of obsidian was also present. Bone density dropped dramatically relative to the overlying contexts, consisting of very few fragmentary mammal bones."

Colors were heavily mottled browns, reds, and yellows. Inclusions consist of peat and wood ash as well as occasional charcoal flecks. The 1477 tephra was also noted in some of the turf debris. Artifacts included square extruded nails, glass, white earthenwares, and a piece of worked bone <023>. Mammal bone was also recovered from [412], covering the range from relatively intact to fragmentary, with a number of heavily burned pieces. The fill post-dates context [410] (as seen in the profile) and possibly context [408] (as noted in the context sheet for that deposit). \nUnit [413] This was a modern cut feature in the southeast corner of Area I. Its original function or intent was unknown, but it was ultimately filled with [412]. It is highly probable the cut was made after the deposition of [408], but it certainly post-dates [410]. Rough dimensions for the cut are 140cm east-west and 60cm north-south. Depth was approximately 35cm. In addition to [408] and [410], the feature cuts [417] (1717 tephra), [419], [423], [428] (1477 tephra), [432=456=457], and [436]. \nUnit [414]/[415] - This feature was a shallow cut for a fence post filled with loose brown silt and half rotting wood. Cut was approximately 11cm deep and elliptical in plan view, steep to gentle sloping side and a flat base in profile. Cut into fill [412]. \nUnit [416] - Interpreted as a potentially natural deposit that covers the 1717 tephra [417]. The matrix was very friable silt mottled orangey brown with patches of yellow turf and possible small lenses of black tephra. The tephra was discontinuous, but did appear to be in situ. The eastern extent of the layer was largely unclear, but one small section of its eastern edge was truncated by cut [413] — the truncation was not visible in the profile. The deposit ultimately proved sterile.\nUnit [417] - This deposit was the probable 1717 tephra. Covered by [410] and [416], underlain by [419], and truncated in the southeast corner by cut [413]. Aside from the truncated portion, the tephra covered the entirety of Area I. The tephra was sampled (#51) to confirm its identity and ensure proper phasing. Five small bone fragments were excavated with the tephra."

The unit could not be distinguished from [420], [421], and [423] during profile drawing.\nUnit [420] - The context was interpreted as a brownish gray midden deposit. The matrix was friable silt, with frequent inclusions of wood ash and charcoal making up as much as 25 percent of the volume. One chunk of possible slag, one heavily opalized shard of glass, and a small bag of fragmented bone were the only anthropogenic materials recovered from the deposit. The north edge of cut [413] truncated a portion of the context. Much of the boundary in the southwest quadrant was uncertain during the initial excavation and could not be identified in the profile.

Occasional, small chunks of charcoal are the only potentially cultural inclusions noted in the deposit. The context could not be distinguished from [420] during profile drawing. \nUnit [422] - This deposit was a thin layer of grayish-blue wood ash that was restricted to the southwest quadrant of Area I. A few very small fragments of bone were the only materials recovered from the ashy lens. The context could be the result of re-deposited hearth sweepings. Boundaries between [421] above and [423] below, were abrupt. \nUnit [423] - The context is interpreted as a midden deposit that covered the entirety of Area I except where truncated by cut [413] in the southeast corner of the trench. Its matrix was a soft to friable silt mottled brown, yellow, and orange. Among the recorded inclusions were charcoal chunks (up to 10 percent of the matrix in discrete areas), occasional splotches of 1477 tephra in dumped turf, and infrequent patches of wood ash. One whetstone fragment was recovered from the context. Faunal preservation also appeared improved with more intact long bone fragments and tooth rows. This was likely the first post-1477 deposit (much of the stratum clearly sealed the 1477 tephra, registered as [428].

The discovery of the quite substantial structural remains adds an additional potential research area for future excavations. Remnants of activity around the structure, including midden disposal, intentionally leveled ground, and later, hay infields point to the shifting spatial mosaic of farm activities that become visible as our trenches provide windows into the past. Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of this excavation has been recovery of well-preserved midden remains from every century of occupation of the historic farm - inhabited continuously since the settlement period in the 9th -10th c."

This previous work has included analysis of domestic mammal remains (caprines, bovines, horses and pigs) as well as wild species - a variety of avian species, local fish of the salmonidae family (trout and charr) and gadid fish from the marine coast (see also McGovern et al. 2006, McGovern et al. 2009, Hicks et al. 2014 and reports on nabohome.org). Analysis of the archaeofaunal assemblages excavated at Skútustaðir since 2008 is ongoing at the CUNY Hunter College Northern Science and Education Center (NORSEC) laboratories as the dissertation research project of CUNY Ph.D. student, Megan Hicks (advisor: Thomas H. McGovern).  Prior work provides a regional comparative data for the ongoing analysis of archaeofaunal remains from Skútustaðir, from the Viking age (AD 871-1000) through the approximately 1910. The work is summarized in this section. \nThe ongoing multistranded analysis of the zooarchaeological remains from Skútustaðir includes: \n• Comprehensive zooarchaeological work in the Hunter College NORSEC laboratory (Hicks 2010, 2012) \n• NSF funded eggshell identification project in collaboration with Haskoli Islands (Hicks et al. 2014 in review) \n• Archival research on livestock management (Hicks 2014 in press) \nRecovery of animal bone specimens during the 2013 excavation was successful; twenty one sample bags of animal bone were recovered which will fill in the slight quantitative shorfall for the middle ages chronological phase. Archaeofaunal remains from other phases will add to the excellent sample sizes already excavated in former years. In addition, samples of eggshell were taken which could eventually become usefull to the ongoing study of intensive wild bird egg collection over time in this region (Hicks 2014 in press). It should be noted for future work, that the spatial patterning of midden material indicates that area around Area E4 was used more frequently for kitchen midden dumping in the Middle Ages, while the vicinity of Area I was used most commonly for this purpose perhaps in the early modern period."

        "Text": "Over two decades of above mentioned faunal analysis demostrates some patterning in the record of animal use in the region and the data from analyzed remains from Skústustaðir connects with developing understanding of patterns. Such patterns indicate the presence of domestic animals, cows, sheep, goats, pigs and horses in the region since the first human settlements (McGovern et al. 2006, McGovern et al. 2007, McGovern et al. 2009). Cows had a central economic importance in the Viking age and approximately 1-6 sheep were kept per every cow. Sheep numbers compared to cows grew around the 13th century where herd composition in the Mývatn region seem to shift to keeping 1 cow per every 20-25 sheep approximately (Brewington et al. 2004, McGovern et al. 2007).  In general, the majority of cattle remains found in Iceland are accompanied by a significant percentage of neonatal cow bones suggesting dairy was a major focus (McGovern et al. 2009). Pigs were commonly kept in the Viking Age but their numbers appear to decline and dissappear by the Middle Ages. Horses seem to be managed primarily for transport but they are found disarticulated, in midden deposits, and may have been eaten occasionally. The practice of eating horses is understood historically to have been a normal mode during the viking age yet scrutinized after christianization. It was apparently reconsidered in the early modern period; in one instance, eating horses was recommended by cultural commentator on farm household economics (Ungi 1893). Skútustaðir's zooarchaeological material so far falls in line with many of these general trends, especially with regard to livestock: observable age at death patterns among cattle bone suggest dairying was practiced in all phases.  Pigs are, so far, not found in any context post-dating the middle ages and horses seem to have been rarely eaten (for detail see Hicks 2010). Sheep seem to be kept as a mixed herd in all chronological phases of occupation analysed thus far. Ongoing research (Hicks 2014 in review) is aimed at fully describing the character of  post middle ages caprine economy and is briefly summarized below."

        "Text": "Beyond domestic mammals, hunting and fishing of wild animal species has left zooarchaeological traces that tell a unique economic story of this inland, lakeside region. Unlike most Icelandic settlements on the coast, Mývatn is centered on a freshwater lake. Therefore, the fish remains of various farm settlements reflect common use of salmonidae, trout and charr. The fish of the cod family, commonly partitioned, dried and traded from the coast to distant transocianic locales are found in Mývatn as a whole, as a product being traded or transported fresh, not dried, 60 km inland from the coast (McGovern et al. 2006). In very recent work focusing on wild animal resource use McGovern et al. also suggests that climate cooling events of the 13th century spurred an up-tick in marine resource at the farm of Hofstaðir including the consumtion of harp seals from the coast (2013). The preliminary temporal distribution of seal bones from Skútustaðir may also correlate with known cold periods when sea ice was common –possible evidence that multiple farms in Mývatn sought this resource in hard times."

        "Text": "As an outcome of investigation of other Mývatn sites - Sveigakot, Hrísheimar, Hofstaðir and Steinbogi - McGovern et al. describe a long term pattern of bird management from the settlement period under which ptarmigans are hunted and the eggs of ducks (anatidae) are collected (2006). The collected eggs are represented by the egg fragments in middens while the hunted birds, are represented by speciated bird bones identified from the same midden deposits. Both bird bones and bird egg shell are found in the long term midden layers excavated at Skútustaðir and are the subject of research for a new study bringing this research toward a long term picture of community level governance of wild resources (Hicks et al. 2014 in review). This potentially 1100 year, long term protection of anatidae for egg collecting was the inspiration for the current two part archaeological project underway which is working to devise a method of identification of bird egg shell and applying that method to archaeological remains.\nIn previous studies (McGovern et al. 2006), eggshell has been identified to the more general level of bird order, therefore the focus of these paleoeconomic studies has not been able to comment on on use of birds for eggs at the level of species.  With the technical and taxonomic expertise of Árni Einarsson of and Kesara Anamthawat–Jónsson (Biology and Life Science Faculty, University of Iceland) a reference collection is being made of high magnification SEM photographs of modern egg shells. Approximately 25 species of bird are being described both qualitatively and quantitatively. This reference manual will then be used to identify the archaeological specimens. The archaeological specimens have preserved differentially, some being very degraded while others appear to be very well preserved. Preliminary qualitative and quantitative observations suggest the presence of swans, geese and smaller anatidae among archaeological bird eggshell from Skútustadir. The work is ongoing in 2014 and 2015. Complementary ethnographic and historical work carried out by Ágústa Edwald (University of Aberdeen), focuses on Mývatn from the 19th century and onward documents records community management of bird egg collection through modern times.

        "Text": "The additional 2012 funding from the NSF has also supported archival analysis of documents pertaining to animal holdings in Skútustaðir and its surrounding district, Skútustaðahreppur. These documents tally cows, sheep and horses by head belonging to each farmer in the district and the farm on which they reside from 1863 through the turn of the next century.  They demonstrate a sharp change in the livestock ratios.  The change entailed a rise in number of sheep kept from 1 cow per approximately 20-25 sheep known from the archaeological record and 1710 Jarðabók to 1:87 in 1882 (Brewington et al. 2004, McGovern et al. 2009, JÁM, Thingeyjarsysla County Archive E 87 6 1882). Similarly, the nation’s statistical register shows that the raw number of sheep doubled between 1703 and 1900 in the Northern region of Iceland (Tölfræðihandbók 1984, 70). This dramatic shift may have in part been due to critical political changes toward free market participation that offered opportunities for live sheep export (as argued in Hicks 2014 in press). Export also removed evidence of sheep proportions from the midden remains being analyzed, which underscores the importance of the documents as a complimentary resource to the zooarchaeology for this time period. Beyond livestock numbers in the landscape, the same documents offer the chance for a detailed study of social structure, wealth difference, landscape use, animal economy and the interactions between all of these phenomena during a time of significant economic change.  This work will produce an important final chapter - the archaeology of farming at Skútustaðir during modernization. \nThe long-term zooarchaeological assemblage from Skútustaðir is evidence of a farm and a farming region that has unique history of community level management of animal resource use and landscape use.  This inland, lakeside region with a strong community organization was a production zone of changing, long-distance economic networks. These social and economic factors form part of the long-term story of the use of livestock and wild species that were hunted, collected and fished."

Window glass was for a long time uncommon in buildings other than churches, and was still rare as an object of trade in the late 18th century (Guðmundur Hannesson 1943, 121).\nMost of the Skútustaðir glass finds from 2013 are fairly modern looking, and it would be most likely that they belong to the latter half of the 19th century or the 20th century. Bottles like the one marked AKUREYR[I] were in use until mid-twentieth century. \nOne very small glass fragment, SKU13-61-085, is from a bottle with a painted decoration. Similar bottle fragments have e.g. been found at Skálholt in 18th century contexts (Gavin Lucas 2002, 54)."

As far as we know objects of pottery were first made in Iceland in the 20th century (Guðrún Sveinbjarnardóttir 1996, 29; 85-6). The value of the imported tableware of pottery can i.a. be seen from those instances where a broken object has been carefully mended by drilling holes in the fragments and sewing or tying the object together with thread. To make the mend waterproof the object was then boiled in milk. Drilled holes, presumably for such reparation, can be observed on two of the Skútustaðir 2013 finds.\n\nClay pipes\nThree of the ceramic finds from 2013 were fragments of clay pipes, all three undecorated stem fragments.    \nSKU13-61-036 stem fragment, no decoration, l. 33 mm, diam. 9 mm\nSKU13-61-038 stem fragment, no decoration, l. 20 mm, diam. 7 mm \nSKU13-61-056 stem fragment, no decoration, l. 22 mm, diam. 8mm    \nTobacco pipes of clay are known from the late 16th century (Mehler 2004, 131).

The oldest documentary evidence for the use of tobacco in Iceland is from the earlier half of the 17th century (Jón Ólafsson 1946, 15). The pipes found in Iceland where the countries of origin could be determined are from the Netherlands, Germany, England and Scandinavia (Mehler 2004, 137).   \n"

They are square (as dice later than the Viking Age usually are). The eyes that indicate numbers are placed in such manner that eyes on opposite sides always add up to the number seven. That is how modern dice are made, but in medieval times eyes could be placed differently. The eyes are made of a sort of „ring and dot“, an outer ring, an inner double ring and a dot in the middle. \nThe Skútustaðir dice were both found in the same context, and may be from a set of kotra (backgammon), in which game a pair of dice is used. In his book Íslenzkar gátur, skemtanir, vikivakar og þulur from the late 19th century Ólafur Davíðsson describes different games played with dice, among them kotra, which obviously has been known in Iceland for a long time. The author has the impression that this game has become somewhat unfashionable in thin times (see p. 306-307).\nDice are not always easy to date. Several dice can be found in the collection of the National Museum of Iceland (see Sarpur, culture history database, www.sarpur.is). Some of these are comparable to the Skútustaðir dice, but they are often without a secure dating, being stray finds or coming from private collections. A pair of dice was recently found during an excavation of a religious house at Skriðuklaustur in eastern Iceland, that was established close to the end of the 15th century and was in function until mid-16th c. These dice resemble the Skútustaðir ones, although it seems that the eyes are arranged differently. (Steinunn Kristjánsdóttir 2012, photo on page 292). Another pair in the collection of the National Museum of Iceland, thought to be made as late as the 1830-s, supposedly of walrus bone (tusk?) by the poet Sigurður Breiðfjörð (1798-1846), is also rather similar to the ones found at Skútustaðir.   \nThe bone artifact SKU13-61-179 is flat, the edges on three sides are whole, one end is broken. On one side of the object there are marks made by a knife or a saw, the other side is polished. It is not obvious what this artifact may have been used for. No traces of wear can be seen, so it is possible that the artifact was not completed.\nAnother bone object, SKU13-61-025, has one flat side, and is likely to be a wedge that was used to fix or stabilize the joint of two wooden pieces, e.g. in a wooden box used e.g.  for hay or wool (Icelandic: meis).  \nSKU13-61-023 is a piece of worked bone, that has broken across a drilled hole. This object could possibly have been intended to be part of a knife handle but unfinished.  \nSKU13-61-167 is a small fragment of a bone object, possible a bone pin with a flat head and a hole through it."

That type was used for handguns. “Many rifles in .22 Short were made between 1901–1940, mostly intended for gallery shooting and small game hunting.“ (information on Wikipedia, June 1st 2014) There are not many animals to hunt in Iceland, except foxes. Seals were sometimes shot, and different types of birds are hunted, but mostly with shot-guns. \nIt is supposed that the first guns were imported to Iceland in the later part of the 15th century, when they are now and then mentioned in written sources. Guns are thought to have been uncommon in the 17th and 18th centuries (Ólafur E. Friðriksson 1996, 14-15).  In the 19th century guns became more common, and there were even a few Icelandic craftsmen who tried their hand at making guns (Ólafur E. Friðriksson 1996, 20-24). There is nothing unlikely about a Skútustaðir farmer in the late 19th- early 20th century owning a rifle and dropping a bullet casing near the farmhouse.\n\nIron\nSKU13-61-001  14 fragments.

Most of the nails found look fairly modern, and are obviously machine made. A number of them are even galvanized. But there are also some examples of hand-made nails and clench bolts. It is not unlikely that the clench bolts are from boats used on the lake. Among the iron finds there is also one (fishing?) hook, one key (possibly two), also remains of a big iron pot/cauldron and iron barrel hoops.  \nThere are some fragments of wire, among them are pieces that seem to be from barbed wire. Barbed wire for fences was first imported to Iceland shortly before 1900, and other types of wire fencing a little later (Sigurður Sigurðsson 1937, 120). In the early 20th century there was a great increase in the fencing of infields, and even other areas.  Laws passed in 1905 made it easy for farmers to get loans to fence their infields, and a certain sum was set aside in the state´s budget just for that purpose yearly for a number of years (Sigurður Sigurðsson1937, 120)."

In the medieval times it was charcoal that was used for ironsmithing. On the other hand there is information on import of coal on a small scale to Iceland in the 17th century (Jón Aðils 1971, 464).  From what can be seen of tables over “Value and quantity of imported goods 1625-1819“ the yearly import of coal to Iceland varied and first exceeded 100 tons in 1796 (Hagskinna, table 10.5, p. 440-443).\n SKU13-61-016 16 small fragments of coal), the largest 22x15x11mm \nSKU13-61-154 12 fragments of coal, the largest 40x38x37mm\nSKU13-61-156 8 fragments of coal, the largest 32x31x19mm \nStone\nThirteen find numbers from Skútustaðir 2013 are stone.

Uncommon stones were often considered to have special powers or supernatural qualities (Jón Árnason 1961,645-653; Jónas Jónasson 1961, 410-411) and when such stones turn up on archaeological sites they may well have been brought to the sites because of this. Three fragments of obsidian belong to this group.  The most likely origin for the obsidian is probably at Krafla (see Hughes & Lucas 2009, fig. 1, page 42). \nTwo of the find numbers (SKU13-61-147 and SKU13-61-180) were on examination seen to be ordinary pebbles of basalt. They have obviously been collected by mistake, and should be discarded."
